Widgets can be configured in the *WP admin > Appearance > Widgets*. Defined widget areas are described in the chapter :doc:`Layout <../user-guide/layout>`.

Most of the shortcodes are self-explanatory. List of the available shortcodes is written in the chapter :doc:`Shortcodes <../user-guide/shortcodes>`. 
Some of them render forms, lists of objects, tables and others just a simple link. Few lines below we will describe purpose of each shortcode and its functionality.

All theme settings can be set in the WP customizer (*WP admin > Appearance > Customize*). Most of them are described in :doc:`Settings <../user-guide/settings>`.

If it is not enough for you, you can use your own CSS to modify original appearance.

.. note:: Don't forget to use a :doc:`child theme <../user-guide/installation>` for custom modifications.
