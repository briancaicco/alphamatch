Reviews
#######

With the theme is bundled plugin called **inventor-reviews**. Please enable this plugin to get an access to reviews system. This plugin changes listing comments to reviews.

Settings for reviews and comments are the same, so global settings are located in *"Settings - Discussion"*. You can also disable or enable reviews for listings individually. In backend go to edit page of the listing and check or uncheck *"Allow comments"* option in section Discussion (at the bottom of the page).

If you can't see this section, click at *"Screen Options"* (at the top right corner) and check *"Discussion"*. If you are logged as admin, you can edit or delete reviews in backend in section *"Comments"*.
