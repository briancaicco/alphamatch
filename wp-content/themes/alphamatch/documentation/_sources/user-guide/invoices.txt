VAT explanation
===============
Let's say your package (or listing) costs 100 EUR. If your VAT is 19%, then invoice item unit price is 84.03 EUR and tax is 15.97 EUR (19% of 84.03). Together it is 100 EUR.

.. note:: Default VAT rate can be changed in the WP customizer. If you need to set custom tax for specific order/payment, you can achieve it using ``inventor_invoices_tax_rate`` WP filter.  


Variable symbol
===============
Variable symbol is an identifier widely used for domestic payments. Is usually used to indicate invoice numbers, but it can also be an order reference or user id.

Additional details
==================
Lines in the invoice billing details can be anything you need. Special payment details, identifiers, address or whatever.
