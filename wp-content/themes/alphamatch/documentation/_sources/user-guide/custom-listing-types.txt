Custom Listing Types
********************

You can either define your custom listing post types in source code by following steps in the :doc:`../developer-guide/custom-listing-post-types` chapter or you can use GUI to create them in the WP admin in section *"Inventor > Listing Types"*.

There is a also video tutorial in the :doc:`../helpdesk/screencast` chapter which can help you:

.. raw:: html

    <div style="padding-bottom:30px;">
	    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IZeWFKhsSZU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    </div>

Each listing type is defined by its:

- plural name
- singular name
- unique identifier
- URL slug
- allowed purchasing flag
- allowed claiming flag
- predefined metaboxes
- custom metaboxes

New Listing type is available immediately after its creation. New listing can be created navigating to *"WP admin > Listings"* or using :doc:`../user-guide/submission-system`.

.. warning:: After registering post type do not forget to resave permalinks. This task could be done by visiting *"Settings - Permalinks"* page in WordPress administration.

.. note:: You will need to add metaboxes (and fields) to the new listing type using metabox manager in *"Inventor > Metaboxes"*, read more about it in chapter :doc:`../user-guide/custom-metaboxes`.
