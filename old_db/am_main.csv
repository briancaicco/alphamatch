Homeward Bound Rescue's Canine Carnival will be held on June 24th, at Lakeview Park, at the foot of Simcoe Street, Oshawa, right on Lake Ontario. Our carnival involves market vendor booths, other rescues, a fashion show, agility course demos, lure course, carnival games for the kids (and maybe the pets too!) as well as raffles and bingo.

We would love to invite other rescues to attend our carnival to bring awareness to your own rescues. While we focus on flat faced breeds, we firmly believe in the mantra  ""Until there are none, adopt one"". We work beside you toward a common goal and would love for you to help use this day to educate the public about responsible pet ownership while having a great time.

Booth fee for rescue organizations is $25.00 and includes a licence to sell goods in a public park. I've included a vendor flyer for you to look at, as well as a copy of your registration form.

If you would like to and are able to join in on our day of fun, we would love to have you.  If you have received this email from another one of my team members, we do apologize, please disregard.

Please feel free to contact me with any questions.

We’re part of a selection committee responsible for producing Ontario's largest outdoor holiday market, happening in December featuring over 200 vendors. We're curating a list of vendors that we think would do incredibly well during our Saturday markets. 

This event will be Ontario's largest outdoor holiday event which includes a beer/wine festival. We are featured on many blogs including BlogTO, InHalton, and DailyHive which have one of the highest amounts of likes and shares they've seen in a while. 

Would you be available to participate on either December 2nd, 9th, and/or 16th?

Attached is our vendor guidebook and floor plan. If you're interested in applying or have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out and I can send you the application form.  You can also apply directly online as well via our website and please put in referral code HSM040.  We'll be finalizing our vendor list in the coming weeks and hope you'll be able to join us. It's a free admission event with a ton of engagement opportunities.

Talk soon,

This is quite common, and should not be confused with the much more serious Rage Syndrome. During the teenage period, dogs will require a firm but understanding hand to teach proper obedience.

He did contract blastomycosis which is a fungal infection. And as a result, he only has one eye. Blastomycosis is neither genetic nor hereditary, and other than giving him a little extra personality, we do not think that missing an eye has effected him whatsoever.

<h2>History</h2>
The <b>Abyssinian</b> is a breed of domesticated cat with a distinctive ticked coat. There are many stories about its origins, often revolving around Ethiopia, but the actual origins are uncertain. The Abyssinian has become one of the most popular breeds of shorthair cat in the USA.<sup id=""cite_ref-2"">
</sup>

The name 'Abyssinian' refers to Ethiopia, but most of the stories about the origins of Abyssinians refer to Egypt. Genetic research suggests the breed originated near the coast of the Indian Ocean, where colonists may have purchased animals from wild animal traders. The breed was developed in Great Britain.

The breed is sometimes believed to have originated from one Egyptian female kitten named Zula, who was taken from a part in Alexandria by a British soldier and brought to England in 1868. This theory is not established because there is no solid link between Zula and the cat first listed as an Abyssinian in 1882.<sup id=""cite_ref-Pollard_3-0"">
</sup>
<h2>Description</h2>
The Abyssinian has alert, relatively large pointed ears. The head is broad and moderately wedge shaped. Its eyes are almond shaped and colors include gold, green, hazel or copper. The paws are small and oval. The legs are slender in proportion to the body, with a fine bone structure. The Abyssinian has a fairly long tail, broad at the base and tapering to a point. The Abyssinian's nose and chin usually form a straight vertical line when viewed in profile. A <i>m</i>-shaped marking is often found in the fur on the forehead. The <i>m</i>-shaped marking, also called ""frown lines,"" appears above the Abyssinian's eyes. They can be colored ruddy, (usual), chocolate, sorrel (cinnamon), blue,fawn, lilac or sex-linked; red, cream and tortoiseshell. Abyssinians are medium sized cats. They have strong, light boned bodies with long legs.
<h3>Temperament</h3>
Abyssinians are extroverted, extremely active, playful, wilful and intelligent. They are usually not ""lap cats"", because they are usually too preoccupied with exploring and playing. They are popular among breeders and owners, and can be very successful show cats. Not all Abyssinians are shown, however, because the color and type standards are very exacting, and because some are shy towards strangers and timid in public. They have quiet, engaging voices.

""Abys"", as they are affectionately referred to by their fans, need a great deal of love and interaction with the family to keep them happy and can get depressed without daily activity and attention. They generally get along well with other cats. Abyssinians are known for their curiosity and enjoy exploring their surroundings, including heights. They are sensible cats that do not take unnecessary risks. As one might expect from such an intelligent and physically capable breed, Abyssinians are known to be formidable hunters. They adore toys and can play for hours with a favorite ball. Some play fetch.
<h2>Health</h2>
It can be prone to gingivitis, which can lead to more serious periodontitis, so it will need its teeth brushed. Familial renal amyloidosis or AA amyloidosis, a kidney disorder due to a mutation in the AA amyloid protein gene, has been seen in Abyssinians. The Abyssinian has had severe problems with blindness caused by a hereditary retinal degeneration due to mutations in the rdAc gene. However, the prevalence has been reduced from 45% to less than 4% in 2008 in the country of Sweden. With the widespread availability of rdAc mutation detection tests and services, such as those provided by the UC Davis Veterinary Genetics Laboratory, it is possible to reduce the disease frequency in all populations of Abyssinian.<sup id=""cite_ref-9""><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abyssinian_(cat)#cite_note-9"">

The <b>Aegean cat</b>  is a naturally occurring landrace of domestic cat originating from the Cycladic Islands of Greece. Development of the Aegean cat as a formal breed began in the early 1990s by breeders in the fledgling Greek cat fancy, but the variety has yet to be recognized by any major fancier and breeder organization. It is considered to be the only native Greek variety of cat.
<h2>History</h2>
The Aegean cat, as its name suggests, originates from the Cycladic Islands in the Aegean Sea, where they occur as a natural landrace. Aegeans are considered one of the oldest domesticated cat breeds. They are common as feral cats in Greece, where they are found amongst fishing ports begging for food. In Greece, Aegean cats are considered a national treasure.<sup id=""cite_ref-cats101-aegean_1-3"">
</sup>
<h2>Aegean characteristics</h2>
Aegean cats are a medium-sized, muscular, semi-longhaired cat. The coat is bicolor or tricolor; one of the colors is always white, without signs of yellowing and takes up between 1/3 to 2/3 of the body. Other colors can be black, red, blue, cream, with or without tabby striping. The paws are medium in size and have a round shape. The ears have a wide base and rounded tips and are covered by hairs. The eyes have an almond shape and their color can be any shade of green.<sup id=""cite_ref-cats101-aegean_1-8"">
</sup>

Aegean cats are noted for their affinity for water and fishing. Because of the way they developed, Aegean cats are free from most feline genetic diseases.

<h2>History</h2>
This breed was developed by Truda Straede in Australia commencing in 1976, hence its name. The breed was developed by crossing theBurmese, Abyssinian, and miscellaneous domestic short-haired cats to create a short-haired cat with a spotted coat. The name was changed from ""Spotted Mist"" to ""Australian Mist"" in 1998, when cats with marbled coats, rather than spots, were accepted as part of the breed.
<h2>Temperament</h2>
They are tolerant of handling, and are not inclined to scratch. As kittens they are lively, but sober up a little on maturity. Their life expectancy is in the mid to late teens.

Australian Mists thrive on human contact, making them happy to remain indoors between dusk and dawn or to be wholly indoor pets, an advantage as most people now prefer to keep their pets indoors. This also protects native wildlife. Some Mists can be trained to go for walks on a lead.

Their tendency to crawl into the nearest lap with or without invitation and to constantly hang around to see what people are up to, makes them excellent companions for home workers and those house bound due to illness or disability. Neutered/spayed cats and kittens fit in easily with all sorts of cats and dogs. Selective breeding has further enhanced these qualities, creating a truly companionable pet, which quickly becomes a member of the family.<sup id=""cite_ref-1"">
</sup>
<h2>Physical characteristics</h2>
Australian Mists are medium-sized short-haired cats, with a round head and large eyes. The coat is very short, without an undercoat. It doesn't need much brushing because of minimal hair loss. The coat patterns have three levels of definition; (1) ground colour, paler than pattern; (2) pattern, delicate though distinct from ground colour; (3) appears to wear a misted veil, caused by random ticking in the solid colour areas. The legs and tail are ringed or barred, and the face and neck also have delicate lines of colour.

<h2>History</h2>
The <b>American Curl</b> is a breed of cat characterized by its unusual ears, which curl back from the face toward the center of the back of the skull. An American Curl's ears should be handled carefully because rough handling may damage the cartilage in the ear. The breed originated inLakewood, California, as the result of a spontaneous mutation. In June 1981, two stray kittens were found and taken in by the Ruga family. The kittens were both longhaired, one black and the other black and white. The family named them Shulamith and Panda respectively, but Panda disappeared several weeks later, making Shulamith the foundation female of the American Curl breed.

In 1986, an American Curl was exhibited at a cat show for the first time, and in 1992, the longhaired American Curl was given championship status by The International Cat Association (TICA). In 1999, the American Curl became the first breed admitted to the Cat Fanciers' Association(CFA) Championship Class with both longhair and shorthair divisions.<sup id=""cite_ref-2"">

<h2>History</h2>
A <b>polydactyl cat</b> is a cat with a congenital physical anomaly called polydactyly (or polydactylism, also known as hyperdactyly), a type of cat body-type genetic mutation that causes the cat to be born with more than the usual number of toes on one or more of its paws. Cats with this genetically inherited trait are most commonly found along the East Coast of North America (in the United States and Canada) and in South West England and Wales.

The condition seems to be most commonly found in cats along the East Coast of North America (in the United States and Canada) and in South West England, Wales and Kingston-upon-Hull. Polydactyl cats have been extremely popular as ship's cats. Although there is some controversy over whether the most common variant of the trait originated as a mutation in New England or was brought there from Britain, there seems to be agreement that it spread widely as a result of cats carried on ships originating in Boston, Massachusetts, and the prevalence of polydactyly among the cat population of various ports correlates with the dates when they first established trade with Boston. Contributing to the spread of polydactyl cats by this means,sailors were long known to value polydactyl cats especially for their extraordinary climbing and hunting abilities as an aid in controlling shipboard rodents. Some sailors also considered them to be extremely good luck when at sea.

Genetic work studying the DNA basis of the condition however indicates that many different mutations can all lead to polydactyly and since samples from the UK and USA were shown to possess different mutations it seems likely that these cats have originated multiple times independently, rather than spreading from a single origin.

Nobel Prize-winning author Ernest Hemingway was a famous aficionado of polydactyl cats, after being first given a six-toed cat by a ship's captain. Upon Hemingway's death in 1961, his former home in Key West, Florida, became a museum and a home for his cats, and it currently houses approximately fifty descendants of his cats (about half of which are polydactyl). Because of his love for these animals, polydactyl cats are sometimes referred to as ""Hemingway Cats"".

Some sources state that these cats are rare in Europe because they were killed as witches' familiars, but other sources indicate that they are quite common in southern Britain. The true polydactyly is a congenital abnormality, genetically inherited as an autosomal dominant trait of the Pd gene with incomplete penetrance.

Normal cats have a total of 18 toes, with five toes on each front paw and four toes on each hind paw; polydactyl cats may have as many as eight digits on their front and/or hind paws. Tiger, a Canadian polydactyl cat with 27 toes, was recognised by Guinness World Records as having the highest number of toes on a cat. Various combinations of anywhere from four to seven toes per paw are common, and the number of toes on either the front or rear paws is typically the same. Polydactyly is most commonly found on the front paws only, it is rare for a cat to have polydactyl hind paws only, and polydactyly of all four paws is even less common.

The nickname ""double-pawed cat"" is a misnomer since there is a specific double paw condition, although this condition may be interrelated with polydactyly.<sup id=""cite_ref-messybeast_2-0"">
</sup>

Feline radial hypoplasia  is a mimic of polydactyly and is considered a severe condition. Radial hypoplasia may cause the formation of extra jointed toes, but it is not a result of the Pd gene normally associated with polydactyls. It thus does not cause the ""mitten cat"" or ""thumb cat"" condition where the extra toes occur separated from the normal ones just like a dewclaw, usually associated with an additional pad which makes them look like an underdeveloped foot sticking out near the base of the normal toes. Rather, radial hypoplasia-related extra toes are immediately adjacent to the normal ones, giving the cat overly large, flat feet ",NULL,NULL,,"Y","0"

<h2>History</h2>
The <b>American Wirehair</b> is a breed of domestic cat originating in upstate New York. As of 2003, though the breed is well-known, it is ranked as the most rare of the 41 Cat Fanciers' Association breeds, with only 22 registered, down from 39 in 2002.

The American Wirehair is a spontaneous mutation of the American Shorthair. It first occurred as a random mutation among a litter of five born to a pair of barn cats in 1966 in Vernon, in upstate New York. This single red-and-white male had wiry fur. The owner of the cats called a local breeder of Rex cats, Mrs. Joan O'Shea, to take a look at the kitten. She bought the kitten for $50, along with one of his normal-coated female littermates, to start a breeding program. The wirehaired male was named Adam, and the female Tip-Top.

Breeding between the two produced wirehaired kittens, many of which were sold off to other interested breeders. As the population grew, cats were exported to Canada, and Germany where they are especially popular. The breed did well, and in 1967 it was recognized by the CFA, and in 1978, it was accepted for championship competition. American Wirehairs have yet to make an appearance in Britain and Australia, among other countries.<sup id=""cite_ref-completeguide_4-0"">
</sup>
<h2>Characteristics</h2>
American Wirehairs are similar to American Shorthairs, with the exception of a springy, wiry coat, including ear fur, and whiskers. This coat is similar to the wire coats of some dog breeds, such as terriers. Their fur requires little grooming, although lighter cats may require sunblock. Wirehairs are of a moderate, sturdy build, with round heads, high cheekbones, and a pronounced muzzle. Females are generally smaller than males. American Wirehairs display the full spectrum of possible cat coat colors, although Himalayan, Chocolate and Lilac are not accepted for competition. The Wirehair coat trait is dominant, so any breeding between a Wirehair and another cat can produce wired kittens. Wirehairs have golden eyes, except for some white ones that have blue or amber eyes.<sup id=""cite_ref-completeguide_4-2"">
</sup>
<h3>Behavior</h3>
The Wirehair has an even, balanced temperament which is essentially identical to that of its American Shorthair relative. Wirehairs are equally content to play or fall asleep in their owners' laps. They have been described as cute and somewhat humorous. They are gentle and quiet, but also playful and active. They have quiet voices.  American Wirehairs generally prefer to stay indoors.

<h2>History</h2>
The <b>Arabian Mau</b> is a formal breed of domestic cat, orginated from the desert cat, a short-haired landrace native to the desert of the Arabian Peninsula, which lives there in the streets and has adapted very well to the extreme climate. The Arabian Mau is recognized as a formal breed by few fancier and breeder organization and cat registry, World Cat Federation (WCF) and Middle East Cat Society (MECATS). Based on one landrace, the Arabian Mau it is a natural breed.

It is medium in size, with a body structure that is rather large and firm, not particularly slender, and with well developed musculature. The legs are comparatively long, with oval paws.

The head appears round, but is slightly longer than broad. The nose is slightly concave curved, when viewed in profile. The whisker pads are clearly pronounced, with a slight pinch. The chin is very firm. The eyes are slightly oval, large and slightly slanted. The cat may have any normal cat eye colour, and there is no relation between the eye and coat colors, usually Arabian Maus have bright green eyes. The ears are large, slightly forward and sideward-placed, high-set on the skull.<sup id=""cite_ref-1""></sup>

The tail is generally of medium length and tapers slightly towards the tip.

The coat is short and lying close to the body. It has no undercoat and is firm to touch. It may not be silky, but is noticeably very glossy.

<h2>Temperament</h2>
Generally Arabian Mau cats have very loving temperaments. The main feature of this cat breed is their devotion, love and affection for the owner. This cat will always be a reliable companion of an individual that loves his cat and cares for it. Arabian Mau gets along very well with children and different kinds of animals. These cats are neat and take care of themselves very well.

Arabian Mau cats were adapted to a desert life style and had to hunt for food themselves; possibly because of this they are not picky about food and they seem to love eating. They like to play and so this breed is very active and curious. They are good hunters, quick and agile. Cats that are allowed to go outdoors, will easily catch a prey and bring it back home. These cats easily jump and jump high. Outdoor cats like to walk around their territory and their house; Arabian Mau are very territorial breed. Males always guard their territory from other male cats.

<h3>Appearance</h3>
It is a medium-sized cat, with a muscular and compact body, which is devoid of fat. It has a broad and rounded chest, and slender legs. The straight tail is of medium length. The pleasantly rounded head has no flattened areas, and there is a very visible spot in profile. This gives the Asian a full-looking face. The round and wide-set eyes come in the colour of yellow.<sup id=""cite_ref-2"">
</sup>
<h3>Temperament</h3>
Asians are very affectionate and lovable, just like its originated brother, the Burmese. It is inquisitive, and loves to explore the house. It has a strong will. It often enjoys traveling in a cat carrier. Asians are highly vocal, and have very loud voices.

The <b>Asian Semi-Longhair</b> is a cat breed similar to the Asian Shorthair except it has semi-long fur. The breed is also known by the name<b>Tiffanie</b> or <b>Tiffany</b>. They are recognized in any of the Asian Shorthair or Burmese colors and patterns. Like the Asian Shorthair, the breed was developed in Britain, and is not currently recognized by any U.S. Registries. It has full recognition in the GCCF. It is related to, and in some registries distinct from, the Chantilly-Tiffany or Foreign Longhair the North American variant.

The Tiffanie was developed in the 1980s in the United Kingdom as a longhaired version of the Asian Shorthair. The breed origins can be traced back to matings between a longhaired cat and a Burmese (cat). It is very similar to Burmillas.<sup id=""cite_ref-Somerville_2-2"">

<h2>History</h2>
The earliest mention of an ALC/domestic cross was in 1889, when Harrison Weir wrote in <i>Our Cats and All About Them</i>

The earliest mention of a confirmed ALC/domestic cross was in 1934 in a Belgian scientific journal, and in 1941, a Japanese cat publication printed an article about one that was kept as a pet. Jean Mill (<i>nǸe</i> Sugden), the person who was later a great influence of the development of the modern Bengal breed, submitted a term paper for her genetics class at UC Davis on the subject of crossbreeding cats in 1946.<sup id=""cite_ref-timeline_4-0"">
</sup>

Greg and Elizabeth Kent were also early breeders, who developed their own line of Bengals using ALCs and Egyptian Maus. This was a very successful line and many modern Bengals will find it in their pedigree.

Although it has become a popular breed, with over 60,000 cats registered with TICA, not all cat registries accept them; in particular, the Cat Fanciers' Association, one of the largest cat registries in the world, does not accept any hybrids.<sup id=""cite_ref-usatoday_5-1"">
</sup>
<h3>Appearance</h3>
Bengal cats have ""wild-looking"" markings, such as large spots, rosettes, and a light/white belly, and a body structure reminiscent of the leopard cat. A Bengal's rosetted spots occur only on the back and sides, with stripes elsewhere. The breed typically also features ""mascara"" (horizontal striping alongside the eyes), and foreleg striping.

The Bengal cat is usually either classed as brown-spotted or snow-spotted (although there are more colours, brown and snow are the only colours of Bengal that the Governing Council of the Cat Fancy (UK) recognize). Within brown Bengals, there are either marble or spotted markings. Included in the spotted variation is rosetted, which consists of a spot with a dark line surrounding it. Snow Bengals are also either marble or spotted, but are also divided into blue-eyed or any other colour eyes.

The International Cat Association recognizes several Bengal colours (brown, seal lynx point, mink, sepia, silver) and patterns (spotted and marbled) for competition and shows. In the New Traits class, other colours may be shown, as well as longhairs.<sup id=""cite_ref-11"">
</sup>
<h3>Temperament</h3>
After three generations from the original crossing, the breed usually acquires a gentle domestic cat temperament; however, for the typical pet owner, a Bengal cat kept as a pet should be at least four generations (F4) removed from the leopard cat.

<h2>History</h2>
The <b>Birman</b>, also called the ""Sacred Cat of Burma"", is a domestic cat breed. It should not be confused with the Burmese, which is a dissimilar breed. The Birman has medium-long hair, a pale colored body with darker points and deep blue eyes. Even though the cat is pointed, the paws have white gloves.

<i>Birmanie</i> is the French spelling of Burma. The <i>Birman</i> breed was first recognized in France by the Cat Club de France in 1925, then in England by the Governing Council of the Cat Fancy<sup id=""cite_ref-2"">[2]</sup> (GCCF) in 1966 and in United States by the Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA) in 1967. It is also recognized by the Canadian Cat Association (CCA), and by The International Cat Association<sup id=""cite_ref-TICA_3-0"">[3]</sup> (TICA) in 1979.

The first traces of historical Birmans go back to a Mme Leotardi in the city of Nice in France.

Birmans were almost wiped out as a breed during World War II. Only two cats were alive in Europe at the end of the war, a pair named Orloff and Xenia de Kaabaa, both belonging to Baudoin-Crevoisier. The foundation of the breed in postwar France were offspring of this pair. They had to be heavily outcrossed with long-hair breeds such as Persian and Siamese to rebuild the Birman breed. By the early 1950s, pure Birman litters were once again being produced. The restored breed was recognized in Britain in 1965 and by the CFA in 1966.<sup>
</sup>

The first Birman cats were seal-point. The Blue-point color was introduced in 1959 using Blue Persian lines. New colors were added by the work of English Breeders in the 1970-1980 including chocolate, red-point, and the tabby/lynx version. A Birman was also used to create new breeds like the Ragdoll cat in California.<sup>
</sup>
<h2>Appearance</h2>
Birmans have a medium size rectangular body. Their ears, which are as wide on the base as they are tall, should be set as much on top of the head as on the side and they have a distinct roman nose. The Birman's body color should be color pointed on the extremities with a cast of color across its body corresponding to the point color. Darker point colors usually have a darker cast across the body. The point colors can be seal, blue, chocolate, lilac, red or cream. Tabby and tortie variations are also allowed. Tortie cats can be seal, chocolate, blue or lilac. The same colors exist in Silver/Smoke version while not yet recognize by all clubs. Australian breeders have been recently working on new colors like: Cinnamon point, fawn point. Birmans have an almost round eye shape with the preferred colour being deep sapphire blue.

The Birman's fur should have a silky texture and they are a single coated breed with NO undercoat at all. Unlike a Persian or Himalayan that has a thick short undercoat with long fur on top, the Birman is truly single coated with only one medium-long silky coat. As a result of this coat, Birmans are known to be non-matting which makes them very easy care. Birmans should have no white on their body with the exception of ""gloves"" on each paw. The white gloving is produced by the white spotting gene and is restricted to the paws only. A spot of white in another area is considered a fault in a Birman cat. Gloves are symmetrical on all four feet. The white must stop at the articulation or at the transition of toes to metacarpals; and all fingers must be white too. The posterior gloves on the back paws finish with an inverted V extended 1/2 to 3/4 up the hock and ideally should be symmetrical.

<h2>Characteristics</h2>
<b>Bombay</b> are a type of shorthaired cats developed by breeding sable Burmese and black American Shorthair cats to produce a cat of mostly Burmese type, but with a sleek, tight black coat.

The Bombay is a highly social breed that loves to be in the company of others. Bombays tend to be attached to their families and crave attention, and for this reason this breed is highly suitable for children. Most Bombay cats are not independent. Older Bombays are some what more independent than younger ones. They seek attention from their owners and people around them often and dislike being left alone for extended periods of time. Although they like to be around people generally, Bombay Cats also tend to have a certain person whom they pay special attention to in their lives. Overall, the Bombay breed is intelligent, playful, and attention-seeking. They tend to get along well with other cats, as they have an established pecking order in the household. They have a very distinctive purr and love to snuggle.

<h2>History</h2>
The breed had developed without rules or special cares; until, in the 1980s, Brazilian-born engineer Paulo Samuel Ruschi, a cat breeder currently living in New York City, started to settle the rules for the breed after deciding to study genetic and morphological aspects of the cats running in parks, gardens and streets of several cities in Brazil. He noticed that the country had unique cats - and yet, that those street cats had the same appearance and features. Those are the characteristics that define the Brazilian Shorthair cat. In 1998 the World Cat Federation, the largest Cat Federation in the world, gave a status of APPROVED BREED to the first and only Brazilian Recognized Purebred Cat, now with more than 10 generations of Pedigreed cats.
<h2>Appearance</h2>
Medium-sized and muscular body, yet elegant. Tail should not be broad at base, and should slightly taper in the tip. Brazilian Shorthair cats have a slightly curved profile and large, pointed ears, and large, rounded eyes with colour that resembles the coat colour. The coat is very short, silky and glossy and with no undercoat. People with allergies of cats suffer the least from this breed. Minimal brushing is acquired. Almost all colours are possible.
<h2>Description</h2>
The Brazilian Shorthair is a medium-sized cat of great agility. The breed can be distinguished from the American Shorthair by its sleek and elegant appearance. Yet, cats of the breed are not as thin as the Siamese. The coat is short and close to the skin and comes in a wide variety of colors and patterns. The space between the eyes should be equal to the size of one eye. Brazilian Shorthairs have dramatically expressive eyes. They are longer than they are tall. Males have bigger heads than females.

The Brazilian Shorthair Cat had its beginning when the engineer Paulo Samuel Ruschi, a cat breeder and founder of the first Cat Federation in Brazil and the first Cat Club in Rio de Janeiro, had the idea to transform certain cats found in the streets of Brazil into a purebred cat. He focused on the Iberian Peninsula cats, brought to Brazil by the Portuguese in their ships around 1500 A.D. From North to South of Brazil, commissions were created by Dr. Paulo Ruschi to study this animal in all of the country's parks and streets. After long years of experimental breeding program led by traditional breeders, the Brazilian Shorthair was finally approved by the World Cat Federation, with headquarters in Germany, as a Pure Breed cat. Nowadays, the Brazilian Shorthair cat can participate in contests all over the world.

<h2>Breed description</h2>
British Shorthairs have dense, plush coats that are often described as crisp or cracking, referring to the way the coat breaks over the contours of the cat's body. Their eyes are large, round and widely set and can be a variety of colours, though the copper or gold eyes of the British blue are the best known. Their heads are round with full, chubby cheeks and their bodies are large and muscular. The breed has a broad chest and shoulders, short legs, round paws and a plush tail with a blunt tip, the tail commonly has dark rings around it at the near bottom.<sup id=""cite_ref-Fanciers_3-0"">

<h2>History</h2>
The background story of this breed is that the original longhaired British cat, through interbreeding with imported longhairs, e.g. from Turkey, was developed into the Persian and became increasingly massive and extreme in type with long, thicker fur than the early Persians. During the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century, the Persian was considered the longhaired analogue of the British Shorthair. During the later part of the twentieth century, a shorthaired version of the modern Persian was developed and was called the Exotic Shorthair; this was very different from the British Shorthair. It was therefore proposed that a longhaired cat of the British type be reintroduced into the cat fancy.<sup id=""cite_ref-Cat_Realm_2-0"">
</sup>

This breed is a long-haired version of the British Shorthair. Much like those cats, the British Longhair has a broad, square head. It is also known as the Britannica in European countries, and the breed is not yet well recognized in the UK itself.
<h2>Appearance</h2>
The coat is lustrous and physique is stout in general. The head is round, with bright circular eyes and short ears. The legs are short too, but strong. The tail is plush and thick. The chest is deep, giving the overall impression of a compact, medium-sized cat.<sup id=""cite_ref-Cat_Realm_2-1"">
</sup>

British Longhairs can come in a wide variety of colours and patterns, just like the British Shorthairs. These colours include black, white, red, cream, blue, chocolate, lilac, cinnamon, or fawn. With all of these colours, the patterns can include self, tabby, tortoiseshell, bicolour, smoke, tipped, and colourpointed.

<h2>History</h2>
The Burmilla was originally created accidentally in the United Kingdom. Two cats, a Chinchilla Persian named Sanquist, and a lilac Burmese named Faberge, were both awaiting a partner of their own breed in different rooms. One night the cleaner left the door open. The two cats bred, producing four kittens born in 1981 that were so adorable that a new breed was born.<sup id=""cite_ref-1"">
</sup>

In GCCF (Governing Council of the Cat Fancy), the Burmilla is considered part of the Asian cat breed. It is accepted in FIFe as the Burmilla. Only the Shaded and Tipped Silver varieties have been recognised in FIFe, CCCA, ACF and CFA as the Burmilla. As of late 2011 the Golden Shaded and Tipped Burmilla is also recognised within FIFe. One governing body in Australia has used the name Australian Tiffanie, however, there is not international acceptance and standardisation for this breed - Tiffany has been used to describe many different breeds having the appearance from Ragdoll to Birman and may contain any of these breeds and more. Many Australian Tiffanies in Australia contain more than three-quarters Persian Chinchilla and retain the appearance and temperament of the Old Fashioned Chinchilla. The name's use is declining in favour due to the lax standards for the breed name, the lack of unique identity and varied genetic makeup.
<h2>Temperament</h2>
The Burmilla is quite an irreverent and independent cat who adores its owner and displays many kitten-like characteristics even into adulthood. In temperament they are sociable, playful, and affectionate, and get along well with children and other animals. Burmillas should be fed a balanced diet of raw meat, canned food, or dry food. Weekly brushing of the coat is recommended.
<h3>Colours</h3>
The Burmilla have a variety of coat colours, including black, blue, brown, chocolate and lilac. Red, cream and tortoisehell (calico) varieties have been bred, these colours are not yet recognised by CCCA in Australia. All the Burmilla coat colours can be expressed in either Burmese expression, or full expression. The Burmilla is now recognised in Golden Shaded and Tipped in FIFe registries, but only Silver everywhere else. The Burmilla's shading comes in two major coat patterns which relate to the depth of colour. These are Tipped and Shaded. Tipped Burmillas have a light dusting of colour (1/8 to 1/4 ) over the top of a silver or golden undercoat. In the case of Silvers, these cats can appear almost white. Shaded Burmillas have 1/4 - 1/2 as their colour giving the appearance of a mantle of colour over the back, shoulders and outside of the legs.

<h2>History</h2>
The <b>California Spangled</b> is a breed of domestic cat that was bred to resemble spotted wild cats, like the ocelot and leopard. They were originally bred in the 1980s and were only ever a rare breed, and usually expensive, priced between US$800 and $2,500. The popularity of two other spotted cats breeds, the Ocicat and the Bengal, overshadowed their development.

Inspired by the poaching death of a leopard, the anthropologist Louis Leakey motivated Paul Arnold Casey, Jr. of California to breed a domestic cat resembling a small leopard in order to emphasize how important it was to preserve the leopard.

California Spangled cats are a crossbreed of many strains, including the Abyssinian, American Shorthair and British Shorthair. Despite their wild appearance, they are completely domestic.

Originally bred by Paul Arnold Casey, Jr., a Hollywood scriptwriter, playwright, and author, after his return from Tanzania while working with Louis Leakey in the 1970s. Casey's novel, ""Open The Coffin"" chronicles his journey in Africa and subsequent breeding that led to the California Spangle.<sup id=""cite_ref-2"">
</sup>

This animal was ideally bred to resemble a leopard, thus giving the impression of a ""House-Leopard"". One of many motivations for this breed was that people would not want to wear the same type of fur that resembled their pet.<sup id=""cite_ref-3"">
</sup>
<h2>Appearance</h2>
This cat gives the initial impression of being a miniature leopard. It has a long, lean, somewhat muscular body and a low slung walk, along with spots. The most desired shape of spots on the cats is round, yet somewhat blockish. Triangular, oval, or square spots are acceptable also. The Spangle's coat may be any of the following colors: bronze, gold, blue, brown, charcoal, red, black, silver, or white. They have conspicuous cheekbones and light, large whisker pads. Spangles may look wild, but are purely domestic and adore playing and interacting with their people.<sup id=""cite_ref-7""><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Spangled_Cat#cite_note-7"">

<h3>History</h3>
The history of this breed began in 1967 when Jennie Robinson (Neotype Cattery) of New York purchased ""Thomas"" and ""Shirley,"" a pair of semi-foreign longhaired chocolate cats with gold eyes and unknown background, which were being sold as part of an estate sale. Ms. Robinson judged Thomas to be a little over a year old and Shirley about six months; they may have come from the same parents but they were not litter-mates. Shirley's first litter was born in early 1969, containing six kittens, all identical, all the same chocolate color, which amazed Robinson and her veterinarian. Intrigued, Robinson undertook a breeding program. In the early 1970s, the ACA registered Thomas, Shirley, and many of their progeny as ""Foreign-Longhairs

Early breeders hypothesized that the cats might be of Burmese descent. However, when the first litter was born in May 1969, kittens were dark self-colors with no points and pinkish paw pads, the opposite of traits that identify Burmese. All the USA cats of this breed descended from Thomas and Shirley. None arose from nor were bred to Burmese.

Some of Ms. Robinson's kittens were sold to Sigyn Lund (Sig Tim Hil Cattery), a Florida Burmese breeder who took on the breeding program. The public thought the chocolate cats came from her Burmese, since their New York origin was not publicized. Ms. Lund coined the breed-name ""Tiffany,"" a name synonymous with elegance and class, after a Los Angeles theatre. She promoted the breed with the ""Tiffany"" name because judges felt the ""Foreign-Longhair"" name was too general. They suggested the name ""Mahogany"" would be more descriptive. None were ever registered under the Lund nam. ACA had dropped the breed from recognition as it was so rare. All breed representatives became unregistered as a result. It continued to be advertised as ""Burmese.""

At one point, the Sig Tim Hil cattery informally supplied information (in a phone interview) to ""Harper's Illustrated Handbook of Cats"" researcher Joan Bernstein regarding these chocolate cats. This interview led to publication of information continuing to suggest the possibility they were Burmese longhairs, the product of UK crosses between Burmese and Himalayans. No such breedings were done in England. However, there had been crosses between Foreign Longhair/Angora, Havana, and Abyssinian. Later this lineage was used in England in an attempt to re-create a cat like an Angora. The American Tiffany/Chantilly is more likely an offshoot of one of these efforts.
<h2>Appearance</h2>
It is a cat with a semi-foreign body style and a full semi-long coat. The coat is silky, soft and smooth; the lack of undercoat usually makes grooming simpler than that of cats with an undercoat. Somewhat a late bloomer, the Chantilly-Tiffany is slow to mature and usually does not come into its full stature until about two years old. The eye color of the feline intensifies with age. The head should be a broad, modified wedge with gentle curves. It should have a medium length nose and a strong, broad, short and softly squared muzzle, and defined but not obvious whisker pads.

<h2>History</h2>
The <b>Chartreux</b> is a rare breed of domestic cat from France and is recognised by a number of registries around the world. It is not recognised by the GCCF in the UK, ostensibly for being too similar to the British Shorthair, one of whose colours is a similar blue-grey. The Chartreux is large and muscular, with relatively short, fine-boned limbs, and very fast reflexes. They are known for their blue (grey) water-resistant short hair double coats which are often slightly nappy in texture (often showing ""breaks"" like a sheepskin) and orange- or copper-colored eyes. Chartreux cats are also known for their ""smile"": due to the structure of their heads and their tapered muzzles, they often appear to be smiling. Chartreux are exceptional hunters and are highly prized by farmers.

As for every French cat with a pedigree, the first letter of the official name of a Chartreux cat encodes the year of its birth, all Chartreux born in the same year have official names beginning with the same letter. The code letters rotate through the alphabet each year, omitting the letters K, Q, W, X, Y, and Z. For example, a Chartreux born in 2011 would have an official name starting with the letter G.

The Chartreux is mentioned for the first time in 1558,  There is a legend that the Chartreux are descended from cats brought to France by Carthusian monks to live in the order's head monastery, the Grande Chartreuse, located in the Chartreuse Mountains north of the city of Grenoble But in 1972, the Prior of the Grande Chartreuse denied that the monastery's archives held any records of the monks' use of any breed of cat resembling the Chartreux . Legend also has it that the Chartreux's ancestors were feral mountain cats from what is now Syria, brought back to France by returning Crusaders in the 13th century, many of whom entered the Carthusian monastic order.

The first documented mention of the breed was by the French naturalist Buffon in the 18th century. The breed was greatly diminished during the first World War and wild populations were not seen after World War II. A concerted effort by European breeders kept the breed from extinction. The first Chartreux were brought to the U.S. in 1971 by Helen and John Gamon of La Jolla, California. In 1987, the Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA) advanced the Chartreux breed to championship status. There are fewer than two dozen active Chartreux breeders in North America as of 2007.

Historically famous Chartreux owners include the French novelist Colette, Charles Baudelaire and French president Charles de Gaulle.
<h2>Temperament</h2>
Chartreux cats tend to be quiet, rarely making noises such as mewing or crying, and some are mute. They are quite observant and intelligent, with some Chartreux learning to operate radio on/off buttons and to open screen door latches. They take about two years to reach adulthood. Chartreux cats are playful cats well into their adult years; some can be taught to fetch small objects in the same manner as a dog. Chartreux are good with children and other animals. They are non-aggressive, affectionate, good travelers and generally very healthy. Chartreux tend to bond with one person in their household, preferring to be in their general vicinity (often following their favoured person from room to room), though they are still loving and affectionate to the other members of the household.

The Chausie was first recognized as a domestic breed by The International Cat Association (TICA). Within the domestic breeds, the Chausie is categorized as a nondomestic hybrid source breed. Other domestic breeds in this category include the Bengal and the Savannah. Because Chausies are mostly descended from domestic cats, by about the fourthgeneration they are fully fertile and completely domestic in temperament. They only <i>look</i> wild. Chausies should be tall, long, and lean, with very long legs and medium boning. The torso is deep-chested with flat sides. The ears are broad, tall, and set high on the head, about two fingersapart.

<h2>History</h2>
<b>Colorpoint Shorthairs</b> are the first cousins of the Siamese and the Cat Fanciers' Association is the only registry that recognizes them as a standalone breed. In all other registries, they are part of the Siamese and Oriental breeds. These cats are distinguished by their elegance in sixteen different ""point"" colors beyond the four Siamese colors. The Colorpoint Shorthair shares body style, personality, coat length, and pointed color pattern with the Siamese, but in the untraditional colors of red, cream, tortoiseshell, and lynx (tabby) points. Two separate schools of thought exist about the Colorpoint Shorthair: those who think that since these cats are pointed like a Siamese, they should be considered Siamese, and those who deem the Colorpoint a Siamese hybrid. In fact these cats were initially created by hybridizing Siamese with American Shorthairs, the same hybridization that created the Oriental breed
<h2>Description</h2>
<b>Colorpoint Shorthair</b> is the name the Cat Fanciers Association (CFA), a United States breed association, uses to refer to pointed cats of Siamese ancestry and type in colors other than the four ""traditional"" Siamese colors (seal, chocolate, blue, and lilac point). This name is also given to cats of Siamese ancestry in the four recognized colors whose eight generation pedigreeshow ancestors with other colors. In registries of other countries, however, ""Colorpoint (or ""Colourpoint"") is the name given to cats of Persian type and pointed coloring, as in Himalayans.<sup id=""cite_ref-1"">
</sup>

In the CFA, a Colorpoint Shorthair cat may also be any of the four traditional Siamese colors; however, they may only be shown in the red point (also called flame point in Persian Family) or cream point, or any of the above colors in tabby point (also called lynx point) or tortoiseshell point.

In all registries except CFA, the Colorpoint Shorthair is not considered a separate breed but merely a color class in the Siamese breed.
<h2>Temperament</h2>
The Colorpoint Shorthair is a highly intelligent, playful, and people-friendly breed. They are extremely affectionate and outgoing and enjoy lounging around and playing with people, causing them to also be described as ""extroverts"". They can also be very sensitive with nervous temperaments, which do not adapt well to changes of environment or to strangers. Like Siamese, they can be extremely vocal and attention-demanding, feeling a need for human companionship. They have over 100 vocal sounds, much more than regular cats, making very unusual meows. Males are sometimes found to be overly aggressive towards other animals, will fight with other cats whenever they feel their territory has been invaded or just to express dominance.

<h2>History</h2>
A <b>Cornish Rex</b> is a breed of domestic cat. The Cornish Rex has no hair except for down. Most breeds of cat have three different types of hair in their coats: the outer fur or ""guard hairs"", which is about 5 cm long in shorthairs and 10 cm+ long in longhairs; a middle layer called the ""awn hair""; and the down hair or undercoat, which is very fine and about 1 cm long. Cornish Rexes only have the undercoat. The curl in Cornish Rex fur is caused by a different mutation and gene than that of the Devon Rex. It originates from Cornwall, Britain.

The coat of a Cornish Rex is extremely fine and sometimes curly, the softest of any cat breed. However, their light coat means that they are best suited for indoor living in warm and dry conditions, as they might get hypothermia if they stay outdoors in the winter.

<h2>History</h2>
The <b>Cymric</b>  is a breed of domestic cat. Some cat registries consider the Cymric simply a semi-long-haired variety of the Manx breed, rather than a separate breed. Except for the length of fur, in all other respects the two varieties are the same, and kittens of either sort may appear in the same litter. The name comes from <i>Cymru</i>, the indigenous Welsh name of Wales, though the breed is not associated with Wales, and the name was possibly given as an attempt to provide a ""Celtic""-sounding name for the breed. The breed's Manx bloodline originated in the Isle of Man, though Canada claims to have developed the long-haired variant. The breed is called the <b>Longhair Manx</b> or a similar name by some registries.

According to Isle of Man records, the taillessness trait of the Manx (and ultimately the Cymric) began as a mutation among the island's domestic cat population. Given the island's closed environment and small gene pool, the dominant gene that decided the cats' taillessness was easily passed from one generation to the next, along with the gene for long hair. Long-haired kittens had been born to Manx cats on the Isle of Man, but had always been discarded by breeders as ""mutants"". Then, in the 1960s, similar kittens were born in Canada and were intentionally bred. This was the start of the increase of Cymric popularity. It took many years for the Cymric to be recognized as a breed of its own by cat associations. The Manx was recognized in the 1920s, but the Cymric was not shown until the 1960s and did not begin to gain popularity until the mid-1970s.

The FǸdǸration Internationale FǸline (FIFE),  World Cat Federation (WCF), American Association of Cat Enthusiasts (AACE), Canadian Cat Association (CCA),  New Zealand Cat Fancy (NZCF), Southern Africa Cat Council (SACC),  American Cat Fanciers Association(ACFA, of the US East Coast), and Cat Fanciers' Federation (CFF, in the US Northeast) consider the Cymric a separate breed. The Cat Aficionado Association (CAA) of China does also, by virtue of the CAA having adopted all the breed standards of its Western partner, ACFA; it is unknown if any specimens are actually in China.

The International Cat Association (TICA) and Australian Cat Federation (ACF) recognize the Cymric by that name but as a variety of Manx, not a separate breed with its own standard. Also simply covering it in their Manx breed standards, the US-based Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA), the Co-ordinating Cat Council of Australia (CCCA), and the UK's Governing Council of the Cat Fancy (GCCF) recognize the variety as the long-haired Manx rather than Cymric (the CFA  and CCCA call it the <b>Manx Longhair</b>, while GCCF uses the term <b>Semi-longhair Manx Variant</b>). Feline Federation Europe (FFE) does not recognize the breed or sub-breed at all, under any name, as of March 2013.
<h2>Appearance</h2>
The Cymric is a muscular, compact, medium to large cat with a sturdy bone structure, weighing between seven and thirteen pounds. They have a cobby body, and an unusually rounded appearance. Cymrics have large and full eyes and have widely spaced ears. Unlike that of the parent Manx breed, the hair of a Cymric is medium-long, dense and well padded over the main body, adding further to the round appearance. All colors and patterns that are accepted for the Manx are accepted for the Cymric (though exactly which qualify varies by organization).

In the breed of Cymrics, four different tail types are produced. The ""rumpy"" is the most valued for cat show purposes, and is the only show cattype in some organizations. This is a cat born entirely tailless. Instead, rumpies often have a dimple at the base of the spine where the tail would be. Next, there are ""rumpy-risers"". These cats have a short knob of tail that is made up of one to three vertebrae connected to the spine. ""Stumpies"" have a short tail stump, up to about 1/3 of a normal tail length. Finally, ""longies"" or ""fully tailed"" have tails as long or almost as long as an ordinary cat",NULL,NULL,,"Y","0"

According to research conducted by J.-D. Vigne, et al. the oldest example of a domesticated cat may be found in Cyprus. In 2004, archaeologists working at the Neolithic site of Shillourokambos, uncovered carefully interred remains of a cat alongside human remains and decorative artifacts. ""Examination showed that a small pit or grave had been deliberately dug out, and the body of the cat was placed in it, then rapidly covered.""

</sup>

The Cyprus cat is linked with the Byzantine monastery peculiarly named ""St. Nicholas of the Cats"", which was founded in the fourth century AD. According to Byzantine legend, St. Helen imported hundreds of cats from Egypt or Palestine in the fourth century to control venomous snakes that had infested the monastery. The monastery had two bells, one to call the cats for meals and the other to send to the fields to hunt snakes. Today, the monastery's population of cats has dwindled.

<h2>History</h2>
The Devon Rex is a breed of cat with a curly, very soft short coat similar to that of the Cornish Rex. They are often associated with being one of the most hypo-allergenic cats available because of their type of coat. However, they are technically not hypoallergenic.

The first Devon was discovered by Beryl Cox in Buckfastleigh, Devon, UK in 1960 amongst a litter of kittens near a disused tin mine. The breed was initially thought to be linked with the Cornish Rex; however, test mating proved otherwise. Cats have three types of hair: guard hair, awn hair, and down hair. The Devon Rex's coat is unusual because there is little guard hair.
<h2>Appearance</h2>
The curl in Devon Rex fur is caused by a different mutation and gene than that of the Cornish Rex and German Rex, and breeding of a Devon with either of those cats results in cats without rexed (curled) fur. Devons, which are medium sized cats, are often called ""pixie cats"" or ""alien cats"" because of their unique appearance. Their uncommonly large, slightly rounded ears are set low on the sides of their wide heads, their eyes are large, and their noses are slightly upturned. Unlike most cats, their whiskers are very short and often curled to such an extent that it may appear as if they have no whiskers. Their body type is distinctly lightly built. Their long, sturdy legs are well suited for long leaps, and their toes are unusually large.

<h3>History</h3>
The <b>Donskoy</b> is a hairless cat breed of Russian origin. This breed started in 1987 with the discovery of a hairless cat in the Russian city ofRostov-on-Don by cat breeder Elena Kovaleva. It is not related to the better known hairless breed of cat the Sphynx, also known as the Canadian hairless, whose characteristic hairlessness is caused by a recessive gene, whereas the Don hairlessness is caused by a dominant gene.

The Donskoy was first officially recognized by World Cat Federation (WCF) in 1997, and by The International Cat Association (TICA) in 2005. The standard of points describes the cat as being medium sized and muscular, with large ears, almond shaped eyes and distinctive long, webbed toes. They require frequent grooming, in spite of their lack of coat. Over-bathing can cause the skin to become very oily.

The Peterbald breed was originally created by crossing Donskoy with Siamese and Oriental cats to create a hairless cat of Oriental type. Matings between Donskoy and Peterbald are no longer permitted.

The eponymous Dragon Li is thought to be a natural self-domesticating breed by way of the wild cat subspecies, Chinese mountain cat (Felis silvestris bieti). While this theory is still somewhat controversial, it has also not been scientifically disproven, and is therefore widely accepted as the origin of this breed within established breeding sources in China. The Chinese character interpretation is based on a legendary description rather than a fully accurate contemporary portrayal of the Dragon Li, and as a result, the breed has been confused with that of the wild fox by the Chinese.

<b>Egyptian Maus</b> are a small- to medium-sized short-haired cat breed. Along with the Bahraini Dilmun Cat, they are one of the few naturally spotted breeds of domesticated cat. The spots of the Mau occur on only the tips of the hairs of their coat.

They frequently land on their back feet when taking a leap, making them appear rather haughty and kangaroo-like. The Egyptian Mau is the fastest of the domestic cats, with its longer hind legs, and unique flap of skin extending from the flank to the back knee, providing for greater agility and length of stride. Maus have been clocked running more than 30 mph (48 km/h).<sup id=""cite_ref-MBGS_2-1"">
</sup>

Maus often possess very musical voices. They are known to chirp, chortle, and emit other distinctly unusual vocalizations when stimulated. Another behavior, quite common in happy Maus, has been described as ""wiggle-tail."" The cat, whether female or male, wiggles and twitches its tail, and appears to be marking territory, also known as spraying, but during this behavior the Mau is not releasing urine. Even veteran Mau owners are known to check after a joyous Mau does this little dance. Facial expressions may change according to mood, and eye color may change from green to turquoise

The exact origin of the Egyptian Mau is not recorded and, therefore, cannot be known for certain. The Egyptian Mau is often said to be descended from African wild cats. A similar-looking cat is depicted in murals and wall paintings of Ancient Egypt. The breed name itself references the Middle Egyptian word <i>mw</i> (literally, <i>cat</i>).

In Ancient Egypt, Maus were used for hunting due to their bird-like voices. Their use in hunting is depicted in murals that have survived the ages. They were small enough not to carry away the prey for themselves and were able to alert hunters to the location of the prey without scaring off other animals of prey.

The modern Camille Mau is said to have originated in 1952, in Italy, when exiled Russian Princess Natalie Troubetskaya met the cat of the Egyptian Ambassador to Italy. She convinced him to obtain several cats from Egypt for her, and she began to breed them. She described her Maus as having a ""troubled"" look, with their round eyes and open expression.

The Mau achieved championship status in some organizations in 1968. There were attempts by British breeders to create Maus from cross-breeds of Abyssinians, Siamese and tabbies, however, these did not resemble the true Maus. This mix became the basis for the Ocicat.

Egyptian Maus will have either a 'scarab beetle' or 'M' marking on their foreheads, those with the latter tend to be from the United States.<sup id=""cite_ref-7"">
</sup>
<h2>Rarity</h2>
Egyptian Maus are a relatively rare breed to encounter. As of 2007, fewer than 200 kittens are registered with the Governing Council of the Cat Fancy each year. As of 2006, a total of 6,741 Maus were registered with the Cat Fanciers' Association.

Maus come in five colors. From most to least common these colors are: silver, bronze, smoke, black and blue/pewter.<sup id=""cite_ref-11"">
</sup>

Black and pewter Maus cannot be shown, but may be used in breeding. All Maus must have green eyes, but an amber cast is acceptable in kittens and young adults up to eighteen months old.

<h2>Origin</h2>
European Shorthair has its counterparts in Great Britain (British Shorthair) and USA (American Shorthair), that have been bred much longer. The British Shorthair however was crossed withPersian Cat and selectively bred to become a cobbier cat with slightly shortened muzzle and thicker coat. It was confusing for Scandinavian breeders that the British Shorthair was also called European Shorthair at that time, even though it looked different. Felinological associations recognized both types of cat as a single breed, meaning they were judged by the same standards during cat shows, until 1982 when FIFE registered the Scandinavian type of European Shorthair as a separate breed with its own standard.
<h2>Breed description</h2>
Head: Fairly broad with rounded contours but a bit longer than it is wide. Slightly rounded skull and forehead. Well-developed cheeks, especially in males. Straight, moderately long nose with no stop and a clearly defined base. Rounded, firm chin. Eyes: Large, round, widely spaced, set at a slight slant. Color must be clear and pure and correspond to that of the coat. Neck: Moderately long and muscular. Body: Fairly long, not stout. Stocky, strong, muscular. Broad, well-developed chest. Paw: Moderately long, strong, solid, tapering evenly to the paws, which are round and firm. Tail: Moderately long, fairly thick at the base, tapering gradually to a rounded tip. Coat: Short, dense, close-lying, lustrous hair without undercoat. All colors except chocolate, lilac, and colorpoint. Fault: Body too large or too stout. Strong resemblance to British Shorthair and American Shorthair. Pendulous cheeks. Clear stop. Long, wooly fur <sup id=""cite_ref-7"">
</sup>
<h2>Temperament</h2>
Because the breed has been developed from ordinary domestic cats, which have very different temperaments, the character of the European Shorthair is impossible to summarise. Members of this breed may be very affectionate but there are others that prefer to be out mousing. Most European Shorthairs are strong and active, and as a rule they are friendly. They get on well with other cats and tolerate dogs well. European Shorthairs are intelligent and playful, and most of them are expert at keeping houses and gardens free of mice.<sup id=""cite_ref-5""><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Shorthair#cite_note-5"">

<h2>History</h2>
The <b>Exotic Shorthair</b> is a breed of cat developed to be a shorthaired version of the Persian. The Exotic Shorthair is similar to the Persian in many ways, including temperament and conformation , with the exception of the short dense coat. It has even inherited many of the Persian's health problems .<sup>
</sup>

The Persian was used as an outcross secretly by some American Shorthair (ASH) breeders in the late 1950s to ""improve"" their breed. The hybrid look gained recognition in the show ring but other breeders unhappy with the changes successfully pushed for new breed standards that would disqualify ASH that showed signs of hybridization. One ASH breeder who saw the potential of the Persian/ASH cross proposed and eventually managed to get the Cat Fanciers' Association to recognize them as a new breed in 1966, under the name Exotic Shorthair. During the breeding program, crosses were also made with the Russian Blue and the Burmese. Since 1987, the only allowable outcross breed is the Persian. The FǸdǸration Internationale FǸline recognized the Exotic Shorthair in 1986.

Because of the regular use of Persians as outcrosses, some Exotics may carry a copy of the recessive longhair gene. When two such cats mate, there is a one in four chance of each offspring being longhaired. Ironically, longhaired Exotics are not considered Persians by CFA, although The International Cat Association accepts them as Persians. Other associations register them as a separate Exotic Longhair breed.<sup id=""cite_ref-1"">

The <b>Havana Brown</b> was the result of planned breedings between Siamese and domestic black cats, by a group of cat fanciers in the 1950s. Similar to the oriental shorthair, full color cats, also known as non-blue eyed Siamese. Early breeders introduced Russian Blue into their breeding, however it is thought almost none remains in the gene pool.<sup id=""cite_ref-2"">
</sup>

It has been documented that self-brown cats were shown in Europe in the 1890s, one name given to these was the Swiss Mountain Cat. These disappeared until post-world war II, with the most likely explanation that the Siamese Cat Club of Britain discouraging their breeding.<sup id=""cite_ref-3"">
</sup>

In the early 1950s a group of English cat fanciers began working together to restore the breed. Havana Brown is the only cat that requires brown whiskers for the Kennel Club Pedigree.

The ladies credited with this effort include Mrs. Armitage Hargreaves of Laurentide Cattery, Mrs. Munroe-Smith of Elmtower Cattery, the Baroness Von Ullmann of Roofspringer Cattery, Mrs. Elsie Fisher of Praha Cattery, and Mrs. Judd of Crossways Cattery. These breeders produced a chestnut (chocolate) colored kitten through mating a black shorthair and a chocolate point Siamese.

While the breed developed in the UK became the Chestnut Brown Oriental and retained the Siamese conformation, it was developed in the USA to have a different head shape and became the Havana Brown. The Havana Brown is not recognized in Britain in this form.

The Havana Brown is a moderately sized, muscular short-haired cat with a body of average length, but are sometimes chubby. They are a moderately active breed, compared to other short-hair cat breeds. The coat color must be brown, typically reddish-brown, with no tabbymarkings. Whiskers should also be brown and the eye color should be green. The head should be slightly longer than wide and the nose should have a distinct stop at the eyes. Males tend to be larger than females and are average in weight compared with other breeds.

The Havana Brown is an intelligent cat that often uses its paws both to examine objects and to communicate with its owners. The most likely explanation of the breed's name - and the one most believed by Havana Brown devotees - is that its coat color is very similar to that of Havana cigars, however, some have also argued that the breed's name is also derived from the Havana (rabbit) which also shares the color.

The breed has been recognized for championship competition in both the US and Britain since the late 1950s. It is considered an endangered breed, since the breeding pool is very small. In the late 1990s, there were only 12 Cat Fanciers' Association-registered Havana Brown catteries and under 130 unaltered cats.

<h2>History</h2>
There is little or no information from the literature or early pictorial representations to indicate how ancient the four main groups of cats are; these being the two varieties of tabby, the single coloured black or white, and the sex-linked orange (marmalade or tortoiseshell cats). In addition, there are other breeds of cat that are more closely controlled by man, such as the Manx, the Persian, Siamese, and Abyssinian, to name but a few. The Cat Fanciers' Association considers the Himalayan Persian simply a color variation of the Persian rather than a separate breed, although they do compete in their own color division. It was for the color that the breed was named ""Himalayan"": a reference to the coloration of Himalayan animals, in particular the Himalayan rabbit. It has been suggested that the Persian long-haired cats are descended from Pallas's cat, Felis manul, a wild cat that inhabits central Asia and which is unmarked with spots or stripes and has very long soft fur. There is, however, no osteological or other evidence for this and it is more likely that the long-haired domestic cats are the result of artificial selection for this character by man. Tests are still being done to discover the descendants of cats such as Himalayans. An example of this research and experimentation is in that of the following: A rare color variant of the American mink (Neovison vison), discovered on a ranch in Nova Scotia and referred to as the ",NULL,NULL,,"Y","0"

<h2>History</h2>
One theory of short-tailed cats in Japan indicates that they arrived from the Asian continent at least 1,000 years ago.  In 1602, Japanese authorities decreed that all cats should be set free to help deal with rodents threatening the silk worms. At that time, buying or selling cats was illegal, and from then on, bobtailed cats lived on farms and in the streets. Japanese Bobtails thus became the ""street cats"" of Japan.<sup>
</sup>

Around 1701, in <i>Kaempfer's Japan</i>, the first book written by a Westerner about the flora, fauna, and landscape of Japan, German doctor Engelbert Kaempfer wrote: ""there is only one breed of cat that is kept. It has large patches of yellow, black and white fur; its short tail looks like it has been bent and broken. It has no mind to hunt for rats and mice but just wants to be carried and stroked by women.""

In 1968, Elizabeth Freret is the first known person to have imported the Japanese Bobtail to the Western Hemisphere from Japan. The short hair Japanese Bobtail was accepted for Championship status in the Cat Fanciers' Association in 1976. Recognition for the long hair variety followed in 1993.  As of 2013, there are a number of Japanese Bobtail breeders, most of which are based in North America with a few in Europe and at least one in Japan; yet the breed remains rare.
<h3>Mutation</h3>
The short tail is a cat body-type mutation caused by the expression of a recessive gene. Generally, all kittens born to two bobtail parents will have bobtails as well, but progeny of only one bobtailed parent are much less likely to possess the trait. Unlike the dominant Manx gene, the Bobtail gene is not associated with skeletal disorders. The Bobtail gene only affects the number of tail vertabrae present

<h3>History</h3>
The Javanese cat is not from Java nor Indonesia. Genetically they are long-haired Oriental. The term ""Javanese cat"" was coined by a Helen Smith of MerryMews Cattery circa 1950. It is unknown if she had ever traveled to Indonesia. The name is derived from the tradition of using the names of the countries and islands of south-east Asia for Oriental cat breeds.

There has been considerable confusion about what constitutes a Javanese, and the breed is treated differently in different countries, but in essence, it is a long-haired version of the Colorpoint Shorthair.

Initially created by breeders who desired a cat with the personality of theSiamese but which sported a variety of colors, the Javanese can now be found in red, cream, tortie, and lynx. So striking is the resemblance between the Javanaese and the Colorpoint that many associations consider it to be a variety of Colorpoint Shorthair and do not recognize it as a separate breed.

<b>Korats</b>  are a slate blue-grey short-haired breed of domestic cat with a small to medium build and a low percentage of body fat. Their bodies are semi-cobby, and surprisingly heavy for their size. They are intelligent, playful,  active cats and form strong bonds with people. Among Korats' distinguishing characteristics are their heart-shaped heads and largegreen eyes. They are one of a few breeds where individuals have only one color.

The Korat is a natural breed, and one of the oldest stable cat breeds. Originating in Thailand, it is named after the Nakhon Ratchasima province (typically called ""Korat"" by the Thai people). In Thailand the breed is known as <i>Si-Sawat</i>, meaning ""color of the sawat seed"". They are known colloquially as the ""good luck cat"" and are given in pairs to newlyweds or to people who are highly esteemed, for good luck. Until recently, Korats were not sold, but only given as gifts.<sup id=""cite_ref-Morris_1-2"">
</sup>

The modern Korats now exist due to the diligent efforts of a few breeders inside and outside of Thailand.<sup>
</sup>

The probable first allusion to the breed is in the Thai <i>Tamra Maew</i> (<i>The Cat-Book Poems</i>), authored between 1350 and 1767 AD and now in the national library in Bangkok. However, the illustration of the Korat in this book is not detailed enough to be definitive as to the breed portrayed. In recent years the Korat was on postage stamp in Thailand. An example hangs in the city of Korat's post office.

Korats first appeared in Britain under the name ""Blue Siamese"" in 1889 and 1896, but as these solid blue cats did not conform to the cat show judges' perception of a Siamese cat they disappeared by 1901. One early import, ""Dwina"", owned by Russian Blue breeder Mrs Constance Carew-Cox and mentioned in Frances Simpson's <i>The Book of the Cat</i> (1903), reputedly produced a large number of ""Siamese"" kittens; the other, Mrs B. Spearman's Blue Siamese male, ""Nam Noi"", was disqualified as a Siamese, but accepted in the Russian or Any Other Blue class in which he placed first (WR Hawkins, ""Around the Pens"" July 1896). Spearman tried unsuccessfully to import more of these ""Blue Siamese"".

The Governing Council of the Cat Fancy recognizes Korat type cats differing from the traditional solid blue appearance of the Korat on their experimental register. Such cats are registered as <b>Thai Lilac</b>, if solid lilac cats, or <b>Thai Blue Point</b>, if exhibiting the colour-point pattern also seen in Siamese. The policy for full registration of Korats only allows blue cats of full-registered parents or third-generation supplementary-registered parents. It also requires genetic testing for gangliosidosis to be carried out to ensure that the breed remains free of this inherited disease which once existed in Korat and Thai breeding lines.

The genes responsible for Pointeds and Lilacs were introduced into the Korat breed when new Korat breeding stock carrying the recessive genes was imported from Thailand. The first recorded Thai Lilac kitten was born to the Jenanca line in 1989, when ""Jenanca Lilac Lillee"" was born from two Korat parents in the UK. In 1990, Lillee's parents were re-mated with more lilac kittens resulting. A young male lilac was then born to another pair, also in the UK, allowing more crossings without inbreeding too closely.

The <b>Kurilian Bobtail</b> is a cat breed (or breed group, depending on registry) originating from the Kuril Islands, claimed by both Russia andJapan, as well as Sakhalin Island and the Kamchatka peninsula of Russia. Short- or long-haired, it has a semi-cobby body type and a distinct short, fluffy tail. The back is slightly arched with hind legs longer than the front, similar to those of the Manx. The breed is also called the <b>Kuril Islands Bobtail</b>, <b>Kuril Bobtail</b> (both often misspelled ""Kurile"") and <b>Curilsk Bobtail</b>, and may be referred to without ""Bobtail"". It is sometimes also spelled <b>Kurilean</b>. The original short-haired variant is a natural breed, known on the islands for over 200 years.  Asselectively-bred pets, they have been popular in Russia and to some extent other parts of Europe, especially for their rodent-hunting abilities, since the middle of the 20th century, but remain rare in North America as of 2011.

Kurilians are recognized as a breed group of a pair related short- and [semi-]long-haired breeds by the The International Cat Association(TICA), which considers them ""Advanced New Breeds"" ineligible for championship status, as of November 2011) and by the FǸdǸration Internationale FǸline (FIFe). The World Cat Federation (WCF) recognizes them as a single breed. As of November 2011, the Cat Fanciers Association (CFA) does not recognize the breed at all.

<h2>History</h2>
The first LaPerm was born in 1982 and was a spontaneous mutation in an otherwise normal litter of kittens. The breed founders, Linda and Richard Koehl owned a cherry farm in The Dalles, Oregon, and had obtained some farm cats for pest control. One of these was an ordinary brown tabby shorthair called Speedy who gave birth to a litter of kittens which included a rather bald female kitten with tabby markings on her skin. The Koehls were initially concerned about the kitten's appearance but she developed healthily and as she grew she developed a soft curly coat.

The kitten was given the name Curly and was given no special treatment, also working as a farm cat. Another key trait of the breed, the unusually affectionate temperament, was only fully appreciated after a particular incident took place. Curly was injured when she climbed into the warm engine of a pickup truck and was injured by the fan when the engine was started. She survived and became a house cat for a while recovering from her injuries and it was during this time that the Koehls observed her affectionate personality. She became pregnant and gave birth to five kittens which had the same appearance as their mother had at birth. All five were male and grew up to have the same curly or rexed coats. None of the five were neutered and they were allowed to breed freely with the other farm cats.

This resulted in a growing colony of unusual rex cats which included long and short coats. There was a range of colors and patterns including chocolate and colorpoints, due to the input of a local cat who had a Siamese mother. When people started commenting on her unusual cats and asking what they were, Linda did some research and realized that she had some kind of rex. She took some cats to a show to ask for feedback and was told by exhibitors, breeders and judges that she had something unique. Several key people in the USA cat fancies gave her their support and the colony was used as the foundation for the breed, which has grown and to become a well established championship breed around the world.

<h2>History</h2>
The ancestral origins of the Maine Coon are unknown. There are only theories and folk tales. One such folk tale involves Marie Antoinette, the Queen of France, who was executed in 1793. The story goes that before her death, Antoinette attempted to escape France with the help of Captain Samuel Clough. She loaded Clough's ship with her most prized possessions, including six of her favorite Turkish Angora cats. Although she did not make it to the United States, her pets safely reached the shores of Wiscasset, Maine, where they bred with other short-haired breeds and developed into the modern breed of the Maine Coon.<sup id=""cite_ref-MCR_6-0"">
</sup>

Another folk tale involves Captain Charles Coon, an English seafarer who kept long-haired cats aboard his ships. Whenever Coon's ship would anchor in New England ports, the felines would exit the ship and mate with the local feral cat population. When long-haired kittens began appearing in the litters of the local cat population, they were referred to as one of ""Coon's cats.""<sup id=""cite_ref-CFA_7-0"">
</sup>

A myth which is trait-based, though genetically impossible,  is the idea that the modern Maine Coon descended from ancestors of semi-feral domestic cats and raccoons. This myth would account for the common color of the breed (brown tabby) and its bushy tail. Another idea is that the Maine Coon originated between the matings of domestic cats and wild bobcats, which could explain the tufts of hairs that are so commonly seen on the tips of the ears.<sup id=""cite_ref-CFA_7-1"">
</sup>

The generally-accepted theory among breeders is that the Maine Coon is descended from the pairings of local short-haired domestic cats and long-haired breeds brought overseas by English seafarers (possibly by Captain Charles Coon) or 11th-century Vikings The connection to the Vikings is seen in the strong resemblance of the Maine Coon to the Norwegian Forest Cat, another breed that is said to be a descendant of cats that traveled with the Vikings
<h2>Health</h2>
Pet insurance data from Sweden puts the median lifespan of the Maine Coon at &gt;12.5 years.  Maine Coons are generally a healthy and hardy breed and have adapted to survive the New England climate. The most severe threat is feline hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), the most common heart disease seen in cats, whether pure bred or not. In Maine Coons, it is thought to be inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. Middle-aged to older cats as well as males are thought to be predisposed to the disease. HCM is a progressive disease and can result in heart failure, paralysis of the hind legs due to clot embolization originating in the heart, and sudden death. A specific mutation that causes HCM is seen in Maine Coons for which testing services are offered. Of all the Maine Coons tested for the MyBPC mutation at the Veterinary Cardiac Genetics Lab at the College of Veterinary Medicine located at Washington State University, approximately one-third tested positive. Not all cats that tested positive will have clinical signs of the disease and some Maine Coon cats with clinical evidence of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy test negative for this mutation, strongly suggesting that a second mutation exists in the breed. The HCM prevalence was found to be 10.1% (95% CI 5.8 -14.3 % ) in this study. <sup id=""cite_ref-40"">

<h2>History</h2>
The <b>Manx</b> cat in earlier times often spelled <b>Manks</b>, is a breed of domestic cat  originating on the Isle of Man, with a naturally occurring mutation that shortens the tail. Many Manx have a small stub of a tail, but Manx cats are best known as being entirely tailless; this is the most distinguishing characteristic of the breed, along with elongated hind legs and a rounded head. Manx cats come in all coat colours and patterns, though all-white specimens are rare, and the coat range of the original stock was more limited. Long-haired variants are sometimes considered a separate breed, the Cymric. Manx are prized as skilled hunters, and thus have often been sought by farmers with rodent problems, and been a preferred ship's cat breed. They are said to be social, tame and active. An old local term for the cats on their home island is <i><b>stubbin</b></i>. Manx have been exhibited in cat shows since the 1800s, with the first known breed standard published in 1903.

Tailless cats, then called <i>stubbin </i> (apparently both singular and plural) in colloquial Manx language, were known by the early 19th century  as cats from the Isle of Man (Mann), hence the name, where they remain a substantial but declining percentage of the local cat population. The taillessness arose as a natural mutation on the island, though folklore persists that tailless domestic cats were brought there by sea. They are descended from mainland stock of obscure origin.<sup id=""cite_ref-Barton_4-0"">[4]</sup> Like all house cats, including nearby British and Irish populations, they are ultimately descended from the African wildcat  and not from native European wildcats of which the island has long been devoid.  <i>Manx</i> itself was often spelled <i>Manks</i> well into the late 1800s.

<h2>History</h2>
The <b>Minskin</b> is a breed of cat derived from crossing the Munchkin with the Sphynx. In 1998 Paul McSorley began the development of the Minskin in Boston, Massachusetts. Just as the Siamese has color restricted to the points/extremities, Paul McSorley envisioned a cat with short legs and fur restricted to the points (fur-points). To accomplish his goal, he crossed is already established Munchkin cats with short legs and fur, with 'fuzzy' Sphynx for the hairless characteristic where fur can occur on the extremities, making for a healthier immune system. He also used his International Award Winning Burmese cats and Devon Rex in the development of his Minskin breeding program. The first cat that met his goal was ""TRT I Am Minskin Hear Me Roar"" 'Rory' was born in July, 2000. By early 2005 about 50 cats meeting the Minskin vision existed and were registered by The International Cat Association. In 2008 the Minskin became recognized as a Preliminary New Breed and is currently in TICA's program that monitors the development of new breeds.

<h2>History</h2>
The <b>Munchkin</b> is a relatively new breed of cat characterized by its very short legs, which are caused by a naturally occurring genetic mutation. Much controversy erupted over the breed when it was recognized by The International Cat Association in 1995 with critics voicing concern over potential health and mobility issues.

Short-legged cats have been documented a number of times around the world since the 1940s. A British veterinary report in 1944 noted four generations of healthy short-legged cats which were similar to normal cats except for the length of the legs. This line disappeared during the Second World War but other short-legged cats were spotted in Russia during 1956 and the United States in the 1970s. In Russia the cat earned the nickname ""Stalingrad Kangaroo cat"".<sup>
</sup>

In 1983 Sandra Hochenedel, a music teacher in Louisiana, found 2 pregnant cats who had been chased by a bulldog under a truck. She kept one of the cats and named her Blackberry and half of her kittens were born short-legged. Hochenedel gave a short-legged male kitten from one of Blackberry's litters to a friend, Kay LaFrance, and she named the kitten Toulouse. It is from Blackberry and Toulouse that today's Munchkin breed is descended.<sup id=""cite_ref-Helgren98_2-0"">
</sup>

Toulouse was an unneutered cat with outdoor access and after some time a population of stray short-legged cats started to form. Thinking that they might have a new breed, Hochenedel and LaFrance contacted Dr. Solveig Pflueger, a show judge, chairperson of The International Cat Association's (TICA) genetics committee and advisor to the Board of Directors. Together with Dr. David Biller, Head of Radiology at the College of Veterinary Medicine at Kansas State University, Pflueger conducted studies on the cats and determined that the short-legged trait has anautosomal dominant mode of inheritance and that the cats did not appear to have any spinal problems associated with those found in short-legged dog breeds such as the Corgi and Dachshund.<sup id=""cite_ref-Helgren2006_3-0"">
</sup>

The Munchkin cat was first introduced to the general public in 1991 via a national network televised cat show held by The International Cat Association (TICA) in Madison Square Garden. Critics predicted that the breed would develop back, hip and leg problems similar to those that plague some Dachshunds.  Amidst much controversy, TICA accepted the Munchkin into its New Breed development program in September 1994. One veteran show judge resigned in protest, calling the breed an affront to breeders with ethics. The Munchkin achieved TICA Championship status in May 2003.<sup id=""cite_ref-TICAintro_1-1"">
</sup>

Apart from TICA, registries that recognize the breed includes The American Association of Cat Enthusiasts (AACE), The United Feline Organization (UFO), the Southern Africa Cat Council, and the Waratah National Cat Alliance in Australia. There is controversy among breeders of pedigree cats as to what genetic mutations are abnormal and potentially disadvantageous to the cat. Several cat registries do not recognize the Munchkin: FǸdǸration Internationale FǸline, which refuses to recognise what they consider a breed based on a ""genetic disease"", achondroplasia. The Governing Council of the Cat Fancy likewise refuses to recognise the breed, considering this breed and others like it to be ""unacceptable"" because they are based on an ""abnormal structure or development"". The breed is also not recognized by the Cat Fanciers' Association. The Australian Capital Territory (a territory of Australia) government consider the munchkin breed to be ""malformed animals"" and the deliberate breeding of them ""unacceptable"" because of the ""genetic health problems associated with such breeding"". Owners and Breeders of munchkins declare them to be ""a sound breed"" that is ""ideal"" for small homes and not particularly susceptible to health problems.<sup id=""cite_ref-WNCA_6-1""><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munchkin_(cat)#cite_note-WNCA-6"">
</a></sup>
<h2>Health</h2>
Although the genetic mutation causing the short-legged trait in Munchkins has been referred to as achondroplasia,  achondroplasia is typically associated with an enlarged head as well as short legs. This combination of features is not seen in Munchkin cats. The condition has sometimes been referred to as hypochondroplasia or pseudoachondroplasia.  Small litter sizes when two munchkin cats are crossed indicate thatembryos that are homozygous for the munchkin gene are non-viable.<sup id=""cite_ref-Messybeast_15-1"">
</sup>

While there were early speculations that the Munchkin will develop spinal problems commonly seen in short-legged dog breeds, in 1995 several breeders had their oldest Munchkins X-rayed and examined for signs of joint or bone problems and found none. However, there appears to be two conditions with increased incidence in the breed: lordosis (excessive curvature of the spine) and pectus excavatum (hollowed chest). Both conditions are commonly seen in humans with pseudoachondroplasia. These conditions can appear in other breeds and some breeders have denied that it is a problem for the Munchkin.

<h2>Origin</h2>
The American foundation of this cat breed was laid by the cats Siegfried (1984) and Brunhilde (1985). Cora Cobb, the owner of Siegfried and Brunhilde, was very impressed by the beauty of her blue/grey cats. Siegfried and Brunhilde looked like a Russian Blue but with a semi-long coat. To find out if it was possible to start a new breed with these cats, Cora got in touch with the geneticist of the American Cat Association. This geneticist, Dr. Solveig Pfleuger, said that the breed was best defined as semi-long haired Russian Blue. Supported by Dr. Pfleuger, Cora Cobb wrote the breeding standard according to the blue Russian, but with a difference: its coat length.

(TICA) was the first association to recognize the Nebelung and provides the breed standard. The goal of the Nebelung breeding program is to produce a blue cat with the same type as those imported from Russia in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries and to combine this type with a thick shimmering coat of medium length. The body and tail are long, the ears large in proportion to the head, and the eyes range in color from yellowish green to green. Size is medium and the body well-muscled. The coat is medium long on the body and longer on the tail, with lighter colored guard hairs. The overall appearance is long, sturdy and well muscled.
<h3>Physical characteristics<span style=""font-size: 1.17em; line-height: 1.5em; color: #333333;"">
</span></h3>
When it comes to the Nebelung, the operative word is long: long, graceful neck and body, long legs, long coat, and long tail. Slightly oval eyes are a vivid green color, or sometimes a yellow-green. Large, pointed ears sit atop a modified wedge-shaped head that is more pointed than rounded. The overall appearance is of a long, sturdy, well-muscled cat. The soft double coat feels fine and silky; it is a beautiful gray color and is tipped with silver. Males and, to a lesser extent, females have a ruff around the neck. The fur on the tail is longer than that on the body. Tufts of fur are found behind the ears and in-between the toes, and the hind legs sport pantaloons. The adult coat reaches its full development when the cat is approximately two years old. Life span of a Nebelung is 16+ years. A Nebelung weighs between 3.5 kg (7.11 lbs) for female and 6.5 kg (14.5 lbs) for male sterilized.
<h3>Behavioral characteristics</h3>
Nebelung cats are lively, playful, affectionate, good-natured, and intelligent. The cat's mild-mannered state and personality may not always reflect the relatively high level of intelligence often found in the breed. In spite of the fact that it is an active cat, it can live very well indoors. Nebelungs prefer their own families and often keep a distance from strangers. They tend to bond with a select few humans and stay loving and devoted throughout their lives. It is, however, a cat that gladly accepts company of its people or of another cat. Nebelungs are very good communicators and will remind their owners of problems. This happens often since Nebelungs can be very picky about things such as litter cleanliness and food type. Many owners of the Nebelung cats say that they can act more like dogs at times, being extremely loyal to their owner and family. It enjoys sitting in a lap and being petted and will follow its favorite person devotedly from room to room. This is a cat that likes routine and may require a little time to adjust to changes in the household. Early socialization can help it become more adaptable.

<h2>History</h2>
The <b>Norwegian Forest Cat</b> or <b>skogkatt</b> is a breed of domestic cat native to Northern Europe. This natural breed is adapted to a very cold climate, with top coat of glossy, long, water-shedding hairs, and a woolly undercoat for insulation. Although this is uncertain, the breed's ancestors may have been a landrace of short-haired cats brought to Norway by the Vikings around 1000 AD, who may also have brought with them long-haired cats, like those ancestral to the modern Siberian and Turkish Angora breeds. During World War II, the breed became nearly extinct until efforts by the Norwegian Forest Cat Club helped the breed by creating an official breeding program. It was not registered as a breed with the European FǸdǸration Internationale FǸline until the 1970s, when a local cat fancier, Carl-Fredrik Nordane, took notice of the breed and made efforts to register it. Currently, the Norwegian Forest Cat is very popular in Norway, Sweden, Iceland and France.

It is a big, strong cat, similar to the American Maine Coon breed, with long legs, a bushy tail and a sturdy body. The breed is very good at climbing, since they have strong claws. The lifespan is usually 14 to 16 years, though kidney and heart diseases have been reported in the breed. Specifically in this breed, complex rearrangements of glycogen branching enzyme (GBE1) can cause a perinatal hypoglycaemic collapse and a late-juvenile-onset neuromuscular degeneration in glycogen storage disease type IV.

The Norwegian Forest Cat is adapted to survive Norway's cold weather. Its ancestors may include black and white shorthair cats brought to Norway from Great Britain sometime after 1000 AD by the Vikings and longhaired cats brought to Norway by Crusaders. These cats could have reproduced with farm and feral stock and might have eventually evolved into the modern-day Norwegian Forest Cat.  The Siberian and the Turkish Angora, longhaired cats from Russia and Turkey, respectively, are also possible ancestors of the breed. Norse legends refer to the <i>Skogkatt</i> as a ""mountain-dwelling fairy cat with an ability to climb sheer rock faces that other cats could not manage."" Since the Norwegian Forest Cat is a very adept climber,  author Claire Bessant believes that the <i>Skogkatt</i> could be about the Norwegian Forest Cat.<sup id=""cite_ref-Complete_Guide_to_the_Cat_6-1"">
</sup>

Many people believe that the ancestors of the Norwegian Forest Cat served as mousers on Viking ships. They lived in the Norwegian forests for many centuries but were later prized for their hunting skills and were used on Norwegian farms. Norwegian Forest Cats would continue acting as mousers on Norwegian farms until they were discovered in the early twentieth century by cat enthusiasts.<sup id=""cite_ref-9"">
</sup>

In 1938 the first Norwegian Forest Cat Club was formed. The club's movement to preserve the breed was interrupted by World War II. Owing tocross-breeding with free-ranging domestic cats during the war, the Norwegian Forest Cat became endangered and nearly extinct until the Norwegian Forest Cat Club helped the breed make a comeback by developing an official breeding program. Since the cat did not leave Norway until the 1970s, it was not registered as a breed in the FǸdǸration Internationale FǸline, a European federation of cat registries, until Carl-Fredrik Nordane, a local cat fancier, took notice of the breed, and made efforts to register it. The breed was registered in Europe by the 1970s, but was not recognized by the American Cat Fanciers Association until 1994.  In 1978, it was recognized in Sweden, and in 1989, they were accepted as a breed in the United Kingdom. The Norwegian Forest Cat is very popular in Norway and Sweden. It is the fifth most popular breed in France since 2003, where there are about 400 to 500 births per year
<h2>Breed description</h2>
The Norwegian Forest Cat is strongly built and larger than an average cat. The breed has a long, sturdy body, long legs and a bushy tail. The coat consists of a long, glossy, thick and water-repellent top layer and a woolly undercoat and is thickest at the legs, chest and head.  The profile of the breed is generally straight.<sup id=""cite_ref-cfainc_18-0"">
</sup>

The head is long, with an over-all shape similar to an equilateral triangle, a strong chin, and a muzzle of medium length; a square or round-shaped head is considered to be a defect. The eyes are almond shaped and oblique, and may be of any colour. The ears are large, wide at the base, high set, have a tufted top, are placed in the extension of the triangle formed by the head, and end with a tuft of hair like the ears of thelynx. All coat colors are accepted except chocolate and lilac and the dilutions fawn and cinnamon. Since the cats have very strong claws, they are very good climbers, and can even climb rocks.<sup id=""cite_ref-Cat_Lover.27s_Daily_Companion_12-1"">
</sup>

Norwegian Forest cats have a quiet voice but can develop a loud voice if kept in a house with a dog. They are friendly, intelligent, and are generally good with people. The Norwegian Forest cat has a lot of energy  and can be very demanding of attention. Those cats that live primarily outdoors become swift and effective hunters, but the breed can also adapt to indoor life. If bought from a registered breeder in the USA, they tend to cost from $550 to $800. The cats usually live to be 14 to 16 years old.  As they are heavy-boned and tall they require more food than most other domestic breeds. Males are considerably heavier and larger-boned than females.<sup id=""cite_ref-22"">
</sup>
<h3>Health issues</h3>
There have been kidney and heart diseases reported in the breed.  In an experiment directed by John C. Fyfea, Rebeccah L. Kurzhals, and others, it was concluded that a complex rearrangement in the breed's Glycogen branching enzyme (GBE1) can cause both a perinatal hypoglycemic collapse and a late-juvenile-onset neuromuscular degeneration in glycogen storage disease type IV in the breed. This disorder, while rare, can prove fatal to cats that have it. There are DNA test available for GSD IV, and it is highly recommended (some cat associations obligate their Norwegian forest cat breeder members) to carry out the DNA test before using such animal for breeding. PawPeds provide a pedigree database which comes together with health programmes, through publishing each single cat's test result, to provide useful information for breeders to make a well-informed breeding decision. The breed has also been known to suffer from hip dysplasia, which is a rare, partially hereditary disease of the hip joint.

<h2>History</h2>
The <b>Ocicat</b> is an all-domestic breed of cat which resembles a wild cat but has no wild DNA in its gene pool. The breed is unusual in that it is spotted like a wild cat but has the temperament of a domestic animal. It is named for its resemblance to the ocelot. The breed was established from Siamese and Abyssinian stock; later, American Shorthairs (silver tabbies) were added to the mix and gave the breed their silver color, bone structure and distinct markings.

The first breeder of Ocicats was Virginia Daly, of Berkley, Michigan, who attempted to breed an Abyssinian-pointed Siamese in 1964. The first generation of kittens appeared Abyssinian, but the result in the second generation was not only the Abyssinian-pointed Siamese, but a spotted kitten, Tonga, nicknamed an 'ocicat' by the breeder's daughter. Tonga was neutered and sold as a pet, but further breedings of his parents produced more spotted kittens, and became the basis of a separate Ocicat breeding program. Other breeders joined in and used the same recipe, Siamese to Abyssinian, and offspring to Siamese. In addition, due to an error by CFA in recording the cross that produced the Ocicat, the American Shorthair was introduced to the Ocicat giving the breed larger boning and adding silver to the 6 colors. The Ocicat was initially accepted for registration in The Cat Fanciers' Association, Inc., and was moved into Championship for showing in 1987. Other registries followed. Today the Ocicat is found all around the world, popular for its all-domestic temperament but wild appearance.
<h2>Appearance</h2>
There are twelve colors approved by ocicat.org for the ocicat breed. Tawny, chocolate and cinnamon, their dilutes, blue, lavender and fawn, and all of them with silver: black silver (ebony silver), chocolate silver, cinnamon silver, blue silver, lavender silver and fawn silver. Ocicats have almond shaped eyes perfect for seeing at night. They also have large, strong bodies, muscular legs with dark markings, and powerful, oval shaped paws. Their heads can be described as having a ""wedge"" shape that is longer than wide. They have very strong facial features, including firm jaws, strong chins, and arching necks. Their ears are tilted at a 45 degree angle with gently rounded tips. The eyes are typically rimmed with dark fur. One of the most striking things about these cats are the dark contrasting spots covering their fur. The body shape of the Ocicat is partway between the svelte Oriental and the sturdy American Shorthair. The breed's large, well-muscled body gives an impression of power and strength.
<h2>Temperament</h2>
Ocicats are said to be a very outgoing breed. Many owners say that their temperament is similar to a dogs. Most can easily be trained to fetch, walk on a leash and harness, come when called, speak, sit, lie down on command and a large array of other dog-related tricks. Most are especially good at feline agility because they are very toy-driven. Some even take readily to the water. Ocicats are also very friendly and sociable. They are not often shy around strangers. This makes them great family pets, and most can also get along well with animals of other species, although they are likely to assert their dominance over all involved. Ocicats make excellent pets for people who want to spend a lot of time with their cat, but they do require more attention than cats who aren't so people-oriented.

<h2>History</h2>
</div>
The history of these cats appears to start in 1984 in New Mexico where they were identified in a feral colony. The first identified cat was a tortoiseshell female named Cornflower. When bred to unrelated males, her kittens exhibited the same blue eyes thereby proving that the trait is a dominant one. But they are still a very rare breed - for example there were only 10 known Ojus Azules in 1992. TICA recognized the Ojus Azules as a breed in 1991 but there are few breeders working with it today. The New Breed program allows for the registration and development of cats and is over-seen by TICA's Genetics Committee. Yearly reports are produced and the health is monitored along with the overall development of the breed.
<div></div>
The gene shows up periodically and may be more widespread than originally thought. Or it may be the work of another mutation. A blue bi-color cat with sapphire blue eyes was discovered in Windellama in New South Wales, Australia, by A M Schneider. Since there have been no imports of the Ojus Azules to Australia, this cat would appear to be the result of a spontaneous mutation in the domestic population there. When in the homozygous state, some health issues have resulted. There is much work to be done with this breed to determine if the striking blue eyes can be conserved without health issues.
<div>
<h3>Personality</h3>
</div>
Due to their rarity, little is known about the temperament of these strikingly pretty cats. The handful that are known to exist are with breeders who are working with geneticists to determine if the gene is viable for conservation. If their efforts are successful, we will discover the underlying personality of the cats.
<div>
<h2>Description</h2>
</div>
The coat is short, soft and silky and they are accepted except for solid white. The standard for the breed is still being developed however the deep blue eyes are a key feature that must be present. The coat itself should be soft and silky. There will often be white patches on the extremities such as the face, feet and tail. They are typically a medium-sized cat with a moderate triangular head shape with a pretty expression and large eyes that highlight the deep blue color.

<h2>History</h2>
The first litters of typically Oregon-Rex-like cats occurred in 1944. The first documented case of an Oregon Rex cat is traced back to a litter of cats in the U.S. state of Oregon in 1955. The specific kitten differed from its siblings and its mother by having a curly coat whereas the others all had straight fur.

At the same time, the first Cornish Rex were imported to the U.S. from Great Britain, and were soon interbred with the developing Oregon Rex breed. Breeders from Oregon then established a purebred Oregon Rex which soon became one of America's most popular Rex breeds. In the course of breeding, however, all types of Rex cats",NULL,NULL,,"Y","0"

<h2>History</h2>
Although some experimental breeding took place during the 1970s and 1980s in the UK, including Pat Turner's Seychellois breeding program, the modern-day Oriental Bicolour owes its origins to matings initiated in the USA by Lindajean Grillo (Ciara Cattery). Starting in 1979, Grillo carried out a series of matings between Siamese and Bicolour American Shorthair. She then selected the best Bicolour offspring to mate back to Siamese or Orientals in order to regain type. The variety was granted recognition by TICA in 1983 and the first champion was Ciara Quite-N-Oreo.

During the 1980s European breeders, principally those in France and the Netherlands, initiated their own Oriental Bicolour breeding lines. A red and white female Moroccan street cat was used as an initial outcross, then later on a Black &amp; White Cornish Rex. Further cats were imported from the USA. It was important for breeders to have different lines in order to be able to mate bicolour to bicolour and obtain a higher proportion of white on the coat, without excessive inbreeding.

FIFe granted championship recognition in 2003 to the Bicolour Oriental Shorthairs and in 2005 to the colourpoint and white cats under the breed name Seychellois.

Although there was a small breeding program stemming from the last of Pat Turner's cats being kept by the late Barbara Lambert(Nomis cattery, breeding under FIFe guidelines), this disappeared following her death in the early 2000s. The first modern-day Oriental Bicolours were imported to the UK starting in 2004 with the arrival of Black &amp; White male Tassam Tom of Landican owned by Sarah Johnson and Pat Norman of the Landican Cattery. The variety gained official Preliminary recognition with the GCCF in 2006. In 2008 the breed progressed to Provisional Status, the fastest breed recognition within this organisation and a mark of the breed's popularity and success.
<h2>Appearance</h2>
The Oriental Bicolour is a cat of Oriental type with a long, slender body and tapering whip-like tail. The triangular shape of the head is made of straight lines with a straight side profile and large, wide-set ears. The eyes are green, except in the colourpoint varieties which have blue eyes. The coat on the shorthaired variety is sleek, close-lying and glossy, while that of the longhair is fine and silky, lying flat to the body with no thick undercoat and forming a plume on the tail. The full range of colours seen in Siamese and Orientals is permitted, however a defining feature of breed is that they always have white spotting. In a cat of show quality this should extend to cover at least one third of the body and the distribution may be random and quirky like splashed paint. There is always a greater distribution of white on the cat's underside and legs in comparison with its back. This patterning is caused by the dominant white spotting gene, which is symbolized with the letter S.

<h2>History</h2>
The <b>Oriental Shorthair</b> is a breed of domestic cat that is closely related to the Siamese. It maintains the modern Siamese head and body type but appears in a wide range of coat colors and patterns. Like the Siamese, Orientals have almond-shaped eyes, a triangular head shape, large ears, and an elongated, slender, and muscular body. Their personalities are also very similar. Orientals are social, intelligent, and many are rather vocal. They often remain playful into adulthood, with many enjoying playing fetch. Despite their slender appearance, they are athletic and can leap into high places. They prefer to live in pairs or groups and also seek human interaction. Unlike the breed's blue-eyed forebear, Orientals are usually green-eyed. The Oriental Longhair differs only with respect to coat length.

While the breed's genetic roots are ultimately in Thailand, it was formally developed principally in the US. The Oriental Shorthair was accepted in 1977 by the Cat Fanciers' Association for championship competition. Since 1997, it has also received recognition from the GCCF and various other cat breeding organizations. The breed is among the most popular among CFA members.

According to the CFA breed profile, ""Orientals represent a diverse group of cats that have their foundation in the Siamese breed."" The Siamese, in both pointed and solid colors, was imported to the UK from Siam (today, Thailand) in the later half of the 1800s, and from there spread widely, becoming one of the most popular breeds. The gene that causes the color to be restricted to the points is a recessive gene; therefore, the general population of the cats of Siam were largely self-colored (solid). When the cats from Siam were bred, the pointed cats were eventually registered as Siamese, while the others were referred to as ""non-blue eyed Siamese"" or ""foreign shorthair"". Other breeds that were developed from the landrace cats of Thailand include the Havana Brown (which some breed registries classify as simply an Oriental Shorthair variant) and the Korat.<sup id=""cite_ref-5"">
</sup>

The Oriental Shorthair was accepted as an actual breed for championship competition in the US-headquartered CFA in 1977. In 1985, the CFA recognized the bicolor variant. Two decades later, the breed was finally recognized by the UK-based Governing Council of the Cat Fancy (GCCF) in 1997, but with some differences from CFA on coat conformation. GCCF publishes separate breed registration policies for a number of specific-coat Oriental Shorthair variants today. The Germany-based World Cat Federation (WCF) recognizes the breed, but with color requirements that are comparatively unrestrictive in some way, but notably opposed to white (""All colours and patterns without white and without points are recognized."")<sup id=""cite_ref-WCF_std_6-0"">
</sup>

In the Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA), some of the point-colored offspring from Oriental Shorthair parents are considered ""any other variety"" (AOV), but depending on the pedigree, some may compete as Colorpoints. In The International Cat Association (TICA) and many other cat fancier and breeder associations, these cats are considered to be, and compete as, Siamese, when recognized at all.

<h2>History</h2>
The <b>Oriental Longhair</b> is a breed of domestic cat. It is closely related to the Oriental Shorthair.

The Oriental Longhair is analogous to the CFA Balinese and Javanese, and the TICA Oriental Longhair breeds in the United States. With no globally recognized naming convention, other cat fanciers may refer to this type as Foreign Longhair or Mandarin. It was formerly known as the <b>British Angora</b> before being renamed in 2002 by British cat fanciers in order to avoid confusion with the Turkish Angora
<h2>Description</h2>
Oriental Longhairs feature a long, tubular, Oriental-style body but with a longer coat. The range of possible coat colours includes everything from self-coloured (black, blue, chocolate, lilac, cinnamon, caramel, fawn, red, cream and apricot), tortoiseshell, smoke (silver undercoat), shaded or tipped, tabby or white. All Oriental Longhairs have green eyes, except for the whites, which may have green or blue eyes, or be odd-eyed (two different colored eyes).

If an Oriental Longhair is bred to an Oriental shorthair or a Siamese, the kittens will all be short-haired. However, if these kittens are reintroduced into a breeding program as adults, approximately half of their kittens will have long coats.

<h2>History</h2>
The Peterbald breed was created during the latter half of 1994 in St. Petersburg, Russia, the result of an experimental mating of a Don Hairless(also known as Don Sphynx, Donskoy or Donsky) male named Afinogen Myth and an Oriental Shorthair female World Champion named Radma von Jagerhov, by Russian felinologist Olga S. Mironova. The first two litters produced four Peterbald kittens: Mandarin iz Murino, Muscat iz Murino, Nezhenka iz Murino and Nocturne iz Murino. These four Peterbalds were the founders of the breed.

In 1996, the breed was adopted in the Russian Selectional Feline Federation (SFF) and given a standard and an abbreviation (PBD). In 1997 it was adopted in The International Cat Association (TICA) with the abbreviation PD, and in 2003 in the World Cat Federation (WCF) with the abbreviation PBD. Other used handles of the breed are PTB, PD and PSX.

These days the breed develops in the direction of modern Oriental and Siamese types, that is to say a long muzzle, large set-apart ears, flat cheekbones, and an elegant body on long legs. Therefore, all standards for this breed encourage mating with Oriental and Siamese cats and semi-longhair variations of those (such as Balinese and Javanese). The Balinese and Javanese were eliminated from the acceptable outcross list in 2005.

The Peterbald was accepted for Championship class competition, effective May 1, 2009, in the American Cat Fanciers Association (ACFA) in August 2008. Effective May 2008, TICA recognizes the ""brush coat"" Peterbald for Championship competition.
<h3>Appearance</h3>
Peterbalds have an elegantly slim graceful and muscular build. They have a narrow and long head with a straight profile, almond-shaped eyes, wedge-shaped muzzle, and big set-apart ears. They have a long whip-like tail, webbed feet and oval paws that allow them to grasp objects and open levered doorknobs. They are somewhat similar in appearance to Oriental Shorthair cats. They have a hair-losing gene and can be born bald, flocked, velour, brush, or with a straight coat. Those born with hair, except the straight-coats, can lose their hair over time. The Peterbald comes in all colors and markings.

<h2>Description</h2>
Ragamuffins are a muscular, heavy breed of cat needing approximately four to five years to fully mature. The physical traits of the breed include a rectangular, broad-chested body with shoulders supporting a short neck. The head is a broad, modified wedge with a rounded forehead and a nose dip. Ragamuffins come in all coat colors and patterns with a medium-length coat that increases in length toward the stomach. Although the coat is thick and plush, it does not readily mat or clump and is easy to care for. RagaMuffins are bred to be sociable, affectionate, cuddly companions that are playful throughout their lives.

The head is a broad, modified wedge with a rounded appearance. The forehead should be moderately rounded. The body should appear rectangular with a broad chest and broad shoulders and moderately heavy muscling in the hindquarters, with the hindquarters being equally broad as the shoulders. There should be a fatty pad in the lower abdomen. Fur length is to be slightly longer around the neck and outer edges of the face, resulting in the appearance of a ruff, and increasing in length from the top of the head down through the shoulder blades and back, with the coat on the sides and stomach being medium to medium long. Every color and pattern is allowable, with or without white. Some color patterns, such as pure white, are rarer than others and are generally in greater demand.

In the 1960s a regular non-pedigreed white domestic long haired cat named Josephine, who had produced several litters of typical cats, was injured in a car accident and taken to a laboratory at the University of California. After she recovered, her next litter produced exceptionally friendly kittens. When the subsequent litter produced more of the same, Mrs. Ann Baker (an established cat breeder) purchased several kittens from the owner, who lived behind her, and, believing she had something special, set out to create what is now known as the Ragdoll.

<h2>History</h2>
In the 1960s, a regular non-pedigreed white domestic longhaired cat named Josephine, who had produced several litters of typical cats, was injured in an accident involving a car and taken to the veterinary hospital at the University of California. Josephine was of a Persian/Angora type and had litters sired by several unknown male Birman or Burmese-like cats, one of which had the Siamese point coloration. After Josephine recovered, her next litter produced kittens with a docile, placid temperament, affectionate nature, and a tendency to go limp and relaxed when picked up. When a subsequent litter produced more of the same, Baker purchased several kittens from the owner who lived behind her, and believing she had something special, set out to create what is now known as the Ragdoll. The breed was selectively bred over many years for desirable traits, such as large size, gentle demeanor, and a tendency to go limp when picked up, as well as the striking pointed coloration.<sup id=""cite_ref-Helgren2006_4-0"">
</sup>

Out of those early litters came Blackie, an all black Burmese-like male and Daddy Warbucks, a seal point with white feet. Daddy Warbucks sired the founding bi-color female Fugianna, and Blackie sired Buckwheat, a dark brown/black Burmese-like female. Both Fugianna and Buckwheat were daughters of Josephine. All Ragdolls are descended from Baker's cats through matings of Daddy Warbucks to Fugianna and Buckwheat.<sup>
</sup>

Baker, in an unusual move, spurned traditional cat breeding associations. She trademarked the name ""Ragdoll"", set up her own registry ca. 1971, the International Ragdoll Cat Association (IRCA), and enforced stringent standards on anyone who wanted to breed or sell cats under that name. The Ragdolls were also not allowed to be registered in other breed associations. The IRCA is still in existence today but is quite small, particularly since Baker's death in 1997. IRCA cats are not recognized in any major cat breed organization or cat show.
<h3>Temperament</h3>
The docile and floppy nature of the Ragdoll is a characteristic thought to be passed down from the Persian and Birman breed. Opinions vary as to whether this trait might be the result of genetic mutation. The extreme docility of some individuals has led to the myth that Ragdolls are pain-resistant. Some breeders in Britain have tried to breed away from the limpness due to concerns that extreme docility ""might not be in the best interests of the cat"". On multiple occasions, ragdolls have been reported as nonchalantly approaching moving cars and vicious dogs and getting hurt. Breed standards describe the Ragdoll as affectionate, intelligent, relaxed in temperament, gentle, and easy to handle lap cat.
<h3>Physical characteristics</h3>
The Ragdoll is one of the largest domesticated cat breeds with a sturdy body, large frame, and proportionate legs. A fully-grown female weighs from 8 to 15 pounds (3.6 to 6.8 kg). Males are substantially larger, ranging from 12 to 20 pounds (5.4 to 9.1 kg) or more. The genes for point coloration are also responsible for the blue eyes of the Ragdoll. More intense shades of blue are favored in cat shows. Although the breed has a plush coat, it consists mainly of long guard hairs, while the lack of a dense undercoat results in, according to the Cat Fanciers' Association, ""reduced shedding and matting"". Mitted Ragdolls, which weren't allowed titling in CFA until the 2008-2009 show season, are often confused with Birmans. The easiest way to tell the difference is by size (the Ragdoll being obviously larger) and chin color (Mitted Ragdolls have white chins, while Birmans have colored chins), although breeders recognize the two by head shape and boning.<sup>
</sup>

Ragdolls come in 6 different colors: red: seal; chocolate; flame; and the corresponding ""dilutes"", including blue, lilac, and cream. This also includes the tortoiseshell pattern in all colors and the three patterns. ""Traditional"" Ragdoll kittens are born white; they have good color at 8 ",NULL,NULL,,"Y","0"

<h2>History</h2>
The Russian Blue is a naturally occurring breed that may have originated in the port of Arkhangelsk, Russia. They are also sometimes called<b>Archangel Blues</b>. It is believed that sailors took Russian Blues from the Archangel Isles to England and Northern Europe in the 1860s. The first recorded appearance outside of Russia was in 1875 at the Crystal Palace in England, as the Archangel Cat. The Russian Blue competed in a class including all other blue cats until 1912, when it was given its own class.

The breed was developed mainly in Russia and Scandinavia until after World War II. Prior to this, a lack of numbers of Russian Blues led tocross breeding with the Siamese. Although Russian Blues were in America before the war, it was not until the post-war period that American breeders created the modern Russian Blue that is seen in the US today. This was done by combining the bloodlines of both the Scandinavian and English Russian Blues. The Siamese traits have now been largely bred out. Unfortunately for breeders and showers, the short hair slate gray/blue color is often seen in mixed-breed cats.<sup id=""cite_ref-3"">
</sup>

Russian Blues are short-haired, blue-gray cats. They usually have green eyes. They have been used on a limited basis to create other breeds (such as the Havana Brown) or alter existing breeds (such as the Nebelung).

During the early 1970s, a solid white Russian Blue (called the Russian White) was created by Australian breeder Mavis Jones through the crossing of a Russian Blue with a domestic white cat. By the late 1970s, the Russian White and Russian Black colors were accepted by cat fanciers in Australia as well as in South Africa and now also in England as Russian cats (in different classes). However, in North America, theCat Fanciers Association does not recognize either variation of the Russian Blue.

Cat Fanciers Association does not recognize either variation of the Russian Blue.
<h2>Physical characteristics</h2>
The Russian Blue has bright green eyes, two layers of short thick fur, and a blue-grey coat. The color is a bluish-gray that is the dilute expression of the black gene. However, as dilute genes are recessive (""b"") and each parent will have a set of two recessive genes (""bb"") two Russian Blues will always produce a blue cat. The coat is known as a ""double coat,"" with the undercoat being soft, downy, and equal in length to theguard hairs, which are an even blue with silver tips. The tail, however, has very dull, almost unnoticeable stripes. Only Russian Blues and the FrenchChartreux have this type of coat, which is described as thick and soft to the touch. The silver tips give the coat a shimmering appearance. Its eyes are almost always a dark and vivid green. Any white patches of fur or yellow eyes in adulthood are seen as flaws in show cats.<sup>
</sup>

Russian Blues should not be confused with British Blues (which are not a distinct breed but rather a British Shorthair with a blue coat; the British Shorthair breed itself comes in a wide variety of colors and patterns), nor the Chartreux or Korat which are two other naturally occurring breeds of blue cats, although they have similar traits.

<h2>History</h2>
The original Scottish Fold was a white barn cat named Susie, who was found at a farm near Coupar Angus in Perthshire, Scotland, in 1961. Susie's ears had an unusual fold in their middle, making her resemble an owl. When Susie had kittens, two of them were born with folded ears, and one was acquired by William Ross, a neighbouring farmer and cat-fancier. Ross registered the breed with the Governing Council of the Cat Fancy (GCCF) in Great Britain in 1966 and started to breed Scottish Fold kittens with the help of geneticist Pat Turner. The breeding programproduced 76 kittens in the first three years",NULL,NULL,,"Y","0"

<h2>History</h2>
The Selkirk Rex is distinct from all other Rex breeds. Unlike the Devon Rex and Cornish Rex, the hair is of normal length and not partly missing. There are longhair and shorthair varieties. It differs from the LaPerm in that the Selkirk Rex coat is plusher and thicker. While the LaPerm gene is a simple dominant, the Selkirk gene (Se) acts as an incomplete dominant; incompletely dominant, allele pairs produce three possiblegenotypes and phenotypes: heterozygous cats (Sese) may have a fuller coat that is preferred in the show ring, while homozygous cats (SeSe) may have a tighter curl and less coat volume.

The Selkirk Rex originated in Montana, USA in 1987, with a litter born to a rescued cat. This foundation cat was bred to a black Persian male, producing three Selkirk Rex and three straight-haired kittens. This demonstrated that the gene had an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance. All Selkirk Rex trace their ancestry back to the cat Miss DePesto.

The breed has been developed in two coat lengths, long and short. It is a large and solidly built breed, similar to a British Shorthair. The coat is very soft and has a woolly look and feel with loose, unstructured curls. The head is round, with large rounded eyes, medium sized ears, and a distinct muzzle, whose length is equal to half its width. An extreme break, like that of a Persian, is a disqualifiable fault.

American Shorthairs, Persians, Himalayans, Exotics, and British Shorthairs have been used as outcrosses to develop this breed. The American Shorthair has now been discontinued as an outcross, except in The International Cat Association. The breed was accepted by The International Cat Association in 1992, the American Cat Fanciers Association in 1998, and the Cat Fanciers' Association in 2000. In CFA (Cat Fanciers' Association) and in Australia, all outcrosses are scheduled to be discontinued in 2015.

The breed is accepted in all colors, including the pointed, sepia, and mink varieties of albinism; bicolors; silver/smoke; and the chocolate and lilac series. This breed has an extremely dense coat and high propensity for shedding. Unlike other Rex breeds with reduced amounts of hair, the Selkirk Rex is not recommended for those who might be allergic to cat allergens.

<h2>History</h2>
The <b>Siberian</b> is a domestic cat breed that has been present in Russia for centuries. A longer name of the breed is <b>Siberian Forest Cat</b>, but it is usually referred to as the Siberian or the Siberian cat. Another name for it is the Moscow Semi-longhair. The cat is an ancient breed that is now believed to be ancestral to all modern long-haired cats. The cat has similarities with the Norwegian Forest Cat, to which it is likely closely related. It is a natural breed of Siberia and the national cat of Russia. While it began as alandrace, it is selectively bred and pedigreed today in at least seven major cat fancier and breeder organisations. The colorpoint variant of the breed is called the <b>Neva Masquerade</b> by some registries, including Feline Federation Europe (FFE). There are claims that it is hypoallergenic and produces less Fel d1 than other cat breeds

The cat was first mentioned in a book by Harrison Wier, which included information of the earliest cat shows in England in 1871. Siberians first arrived in the United States in 1990. Although gaining in popularity, the expense of importing the cats from Russia keeps the breed relatively rare outside of Europe.

In the Russian cat fancy, each cat club devises its own cat standards. This fact led to much confusion in the USA and other countries when the first Siberians were arriving and many appeared quite different from each other, depending on what area of Russia they originated from. One of the earliest written Siberian standards was publicized by the Kotofei cat club in St. Petersburg in 1987. A Siberian cat, Dorofei, is owned by Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, and another by former Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev. WBZ-AM talk radio host Steve LeVeille mentions his Siberian ""Max"" on hisBoston-based program.

<h2>History</h2>
In 1975, after a working stint in Singapore, Tommy and Hal Meadow returned to the US with what they say were three local brown-ticked cats. These three cats, a pair of male and female kittens from the same litter and another young female, were the foundation used to establish the Singapura. The breed takes its name from the Malay name for Singapore. In 1981 a breeder visited Singapore and chanced upon a cat fitting the profile of the Singapura (with the exception of the tail) in the local Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. The cat was imported to the US and adopted into the breeding program.<sup id=""cite_ref-CM_1-1"">
</sup>

The Singapura was accepted for registration by the CFA in 1982 and granted championship status in 1988. In between this period, breeders found that the occasional litter would have a solid colored kitten, caused by the recessive gene for solid color. In a desire for the Singapura to breed true, many breeders chose to do test matings to pinpoint and remove from their breeding programs individuals with the recessive gene. It was discovered that two of the three foundation cats carried this gene.<sup id=""cite_ref-HM_3-0"">
</sup>
<h2>Description</h2>
The Singapura is a moderately stocky and muscular and is one of the worlds smallest cats, with a very short and fine coat. A full grown female usually weighs 5-6 pounds while the male weighs 6-8 pounds. The large, slightly pointed and deep cupped ears together with the large almond shaped eyes are characteristics of the breed. The tail is slender, slightly shorter than the length of the body and has a blunt tip.<sup id=""cite_ref-standard_9-0"">
</sup>

The breed's coat pattern is that of a ticked tabby. That is, individual hair strands have alternating sections of dark and light color, typically two dark bands separated by two light bands, with a dark color at the tip. The underside, including the chest, muzzle and chin, takes the color of the light bands. The Singapura is recognized by cat registries in only one color, the sepia agouti, described as ""dark brown ticking on a warm old ivory ground color"".<sup id=""cite_ref-standard_9-1""></sup><sup id=""cite_ref-profile_10-1"">
</sup>

The Singapura is described by the CFA as active, curious and playful. They are affectionate and desire human interaction. They have a tendency to perch on high places, to allow them a better view of their surrounding.

<h2>History</h2>
The <b>Snowshoe</b> is a rare breed of cat originating in the United States of America in the 1960s. Snowshoes were first produced in Philadelphiawhen a Siamese breeder's cat gave birth to three kittens with white feet. The breeder, Dorothy Hinds-Daugherty, then began a breeding program to produce what were originally called ""Silver Laces"", crossing the strangely marked Siamese cats with bi-color American Shorthaircats and other breeds. When Hinds-Daugherty left the program, Vikki Olander began working with the cats and recruited new breeders, as well as worked towards full recognition within cat associations. Despite having existed for 45 years, Snowshoes are rare due to the difficulty of reproducing the correct coat markings. The marks are based on recessive genes for color points and on the co-dominant but variably-expressed piebald pattern gene, making it difficult to predict the appearance of offspring.

The coat coloration recognized by registries and associations is point coloration, and it comes in a variety of colors, though some organizations do not recognize certain colors. Snowshoe cats have an affectionate and docile disposition. Due to this, they do not do well under circumstances where they are left alone for long periods of time. Snowshoes are also very vocal, though their voices are not as loud as the Siamese, a cat found in their breed heritage. They are noted as being very intelligent and have the ability to learn tricks and open doors. These cats also enjoy water, and may swim.

In the 1960s, a cat, owned by Siamese cat breeder Dorothy Hinds-Daugherty, produced a litter of Siamese kittens in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Three of the kittens had unique markings, consisting of white points and feet. Intrigued by their looks, she began working to breed cats like them, using seal point Siamese with bicolor American Shorthairs. The offspring of those cats lacked the Siamese points, but by breeding the offspring to Siamese cats, the desired look was accomplished. Hinds-Daugherty named the breed ""Snowshoe"" because of their white feet. Hinds-Daugherty promoted the Snowshoe at local cats shows, though they were not recognized at the time. Hinds-Daughtery eventually abandoned the Snowshoe breeding program, and it was taken up by Vikki Olander.<sup id=""cite_ref-planet_2-2""></sup><sup id=""cite_ref-iams_3-3"">
</sup>

Olander wrote the first breed standard for the Snowshoe, and succeeded in obtaining the Cat Fanciers Federation (CFF) and the American Cat Association's (ACA) ""experimental breed"" status for the Snowshoe in 1974. However, by 1977, Olander was the last breeder of the Snowshoe in the United States. After struggling to keep the breed alive, Olander was contacted by Jim Hoffman and Georgia Kuhnell, who were interested in the breed. Other breeders joined Olander, Hoffman, and Kuhnell, and they obtained the champion status from the CFF in 1983. In 1989, Olander left the program, as her fiancǸ was allergic to cats. However, by then the Snowshoe had a strong following, and the breed attained champion status with theAmerican Cat Fanciers Association in 1990 and was recognized by The International Cat Association in 1993. Currently, breeders work to attain acceptance with the Cat Fanciers Association, but struggle with the lack of cats and breeders needed for the association's requirements.<sup id=""cite_ref-planet_2-7"">
</sup>

In the UK a breeding programme was started in 1986. By 1998, Mollie Southall of Coldenufforsnow Cattery  joined the programme, there was only one breeder left, Maureen Shackell. Between them, they had five cats to save the breed. Mollie's senior male, Ferry Vom Friedewald, is an import from Germany and gave us a completely new bloodline. Concerned with progressing the breed and widening the gene pool even further Kelly Cruse of Destrier Cats  got involved in 2006, introducing new colours and patterns. Destrier Dodge Viper  son of the famous Southpole JFK (face of the Snowshoe Cat Club)  was the first Apricot Snowshoe known worldwide. Ultimately with team effort and dedicated breeders all over the UK bringing the Snowshoe Cat to full breed Status with the GCCF elected during the council meeting on 26 June 2013. Snowshoe Cats from 26 October 2013 will be officially be allowed to be shown at Championship level with the GCCF

The first <b>Somali</b> cats appeared in the litters of Abyssinians as long-haired kittens. In the 1940s a British breeder named Janet Robertson exported some Abyssinian kittens to Australia, New Zealand and North America. Descendants of these cats occasionally produced kittens with long or fuzzy coats. In 1963, Mary Mailing, a breeder from Canada, entered one into a local pet show. Ken McGill, the show's judge, asked for one for breeding purposes.

An American Abyssinian breeder Evelyn Mague, also received longhairs from her cats, which she named ""Somalis"". Don Richings, another Canadian breeder, used kittens from McGill, and began to work with Mague. The first Somali recognized as such by a fancier organization was Mayling Tutsuta, one of McGill's cats. As of the late 1970s, the Somali was fully accepted in North America. The new breed was accepted in Europe in the 1980s. By 1991, the breed was broadly (though not universally) accepted internationally

<h2>History</h2>
Although hairless cats have been reported throughout history, breeders in Europe have been working on the Sphynx breed since the early 1960s. Like so many other feline breeds, the present day Sphynx line has been a creation of the simultaneous work performed by nature and many committed, competent individuals. Two different sets of hairless felines discovered in North America in the 1970s provided the foundation cats for that which was shaped into the existing Sphynx breed

The current American and European Sphynx (also known as Canadian Sphynx) breed is descended from two lines of natural mutations:
<ul>
	<li>Dermis and Epidermis (1975) from the Pearsons of Wadena, Minnesota, USA.</li>
	<li>Bambi, Punkie, and Paloma (1978) found in Toronto, Canada, and raised by Shirley Smith.<sup id=""cite_ref-2"">
</sup></li>
</ul>
The Canadian Sphynx breed was started in 1966, in Roncesvalles, Toronto when a hairless kitten named Prune was born to a black and white domestic shorthair queen (Elizabeth) in Ontario, Canada. The kitten was mated with its mother (backcrossing), which produced one more naked kitten. Together with a few naked kittens found later it founded the first attempt to create a hairless breed.

After purchasing these cats in 1966 and initially referring to them as ""Moonstones"" and ""Canadian Hairless,"" Mr. Ridyadh Bawa, a science graduate of the University of Toronto, combined efforts with his mother Yania, a long time Siamese breeder, and the Tenhoves (Kees and Rita) to develop a breed of cats which was subsequently renamed as ""Sphynx"". It is apparent that the Bawas and the Tenhoves were the first individuals able to determine the autosomal recessive nature of the Sphynx gene for hairlessness while also being successful in transforming this knowledge into a successful breeding program with kittens which were eventually capable of reproducing.

The Tenhoves were initially able to get the breed Provisional showing status through the Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA) but ultimately had the status revoked in 1971 when it was felt by the CFA Board that the breed lacked both a consistent standard and an adequately broad gene pool.

The first noted naturally occurring foundation Sphynx originated at the Wadena, Minnesota farm of Milt and Ethelyn Pearson, who identified hairless kittens occurring in several litters of their Domestic Shorthair (DSH) barn cats in the mid-1970s. Two hairless female kittens born in 1975 and 1976, Epidermis and Dermis, became an important part of the Sphynx breeding programme and further hairless cats were found in Texas, Arkansas, and Minnesota. Modern Sphynx, therefore, trace their origins to the second Canadian bloodline and to the Minnesota cats.

The first breeders had rather vague ideas about Sphynx genetics and faced a number of problems. The genetic pool was very limited and many kittens died. There was also a problem with many of the females suffering convulsions. The last two descendants of Prune, a brother-sister pair, were sent to Holland in the 1970s, but the male was uninterested in mating and the female conceived only once, but lost the litter.
<h2>Breeding</h2>
Other hairless breeds might have body shapes or temperaments that differ from those described above. There are, for example, new hairless breeds, including the Don Sphynx and the Peterbald from Russia, which arose from their own spontaneous mutations. The standard for the Sphynx differs between cat associations such as TICA, FIFE and CFA.

In 2010, DNA analysis confirmed that Sphynx hairlessness was produced by an allele of the same gene that produces the Devon Rex (re), with the Sphynx allele being incompletely dominant over the Devon allele and both recessive to the wild type. However a different genetic symbol (hr) is given to the Sphynx gene and it is more likely that these are different genes interacting with each other. The only allowable outcross breeds in the CFA are now the American Shorthair and Domestic Shorthair. Other associations may vary and the Russian Blue is a permitted outcross in the GCCF. In Europe, mainly Devon Rex has been used for outcrosses.

In 1999 SGC Apophis Nordstrom of Classical Cats won the TICA International Alter of the Year. In 2006 SGC Classical Cats Valentino] won the TICA International Cat of the year. In the Cat Fancier's Association, <i>GC, RW, NW Majikmoon Will Silver With Age</i> was Cat of the Year for 2006. The following year, <i>GC, RW, NW Enchantedlair NWA Cornflake Girl</i> was Kitten of the Year. These awards are handed out for the highest scoring cats, across all breeds during the current show seasons.

<h2>History</h2>
<b>Thai</b> is a newly classified but old cat breed, related to but distinct from the modern Western Siamese cat. This natural breed, descended from the landrace of cats of Thailand, has also been variously called <b>Old-style</b>, <b>Traditional</b> and <b>Classic Siamese</b>.

Cats that were imported from Siam to Western countries in the 19th and early 20th century were broader in features than the modern WesternSiamese. While the Thai, known in Thailand as the <i>wichien-maat</i>, has common ancestry with the Western Siamese, generations of separate breeding of these two cats have spearheaded the development of two distinct breeds. The International Cat Association (TICA), approved the look of the Old-style Siamese to be shown as Thai in the Preliminary New Breed category, February 17, 2007. This approval was for a cat that represents the early 20th-century Siamese and can still be found in Thailand catteries, and was shown beginning in 1993 in Europe. Around the world, registered Siamese and imported <i>wichien-maat</i> cats have played a pivotal role in the development of the Thai cat. Breeders internationally banded together to save the old-style look. As of May 1, 2010, the Thai has Championship status in TICA, enabling it to compete along with the other breeds of pedigreed cats.

In Thailand the landrace ancestor of this elegant cat is known as the <i>wichien-maat</i> which means 'moon diamond' or 'diamonds and gold'. The<i>wichien-maat</i>, along with other cats, is named, described and illustrated centuries ago in the ""Tamra Maew"" book of cat poems. Over the years, the <i>wichien-maat</i> has stayed true to its original breeding, which is still seen today in Thailand where it remains a popular cat.

Starting in the late 1800s, the <i>wichien-maat</i> was first imported to the West, starting with England, and the cats became known as ""Siamese"" or the ""Royal Cat of Siam"", after the name of the ruling dynasty at the time in Siam (today Thailand.) Cat fanciers were impressed with the graceful, ""marten-faced"" cats so very different from the cobby, rounder native breeds and longhairs. Western breeders wanted to emphasize and augment the qualities that made the cats so different and through selective breeding, they developed an increasingly elongated, angular, finer-boned type of Siamese. This ""modern"" or ""show-style"" type of Siamese dominated in the show halls beginning in the latter half of the 20th century. As the new look increased in popularity, some breeders in England, Europe, and North America continued to preserve the look of the Old-style Siamese first imported, and the cat still commonly seen today in Thailand as the <i>wichien-maat</i>.

In the early 1990s a pioneering German woman introduced a Siamese cat that represented the classic look of the Old-style Siamese to the show halls in Europe. She called the cat ""Thai."" Her dedication to revitalizing the old look using Siamese bloodlines inspired European breeders to begin breeding and showing a cat called ""Thai."" As a result, numerous independent clubs developed their own breed standards so their members would promote these cats. Across the Atlantic in North America, another breeder worked passionately to preserve old bloodlines that were not seen in the show-style Siamese. This breeder traveled to Thailand to import new bloodlines. Together, American and European breeders began sharing bloodlines and working cooperatively through a small breed club called the Prestwick-Beresford Old-Style Siamese Breed Preservation Society (PREOSSIA).

The <b>toyger</b> is a breed of domestic cat, the result of breeding domestic shorthaired tabbies (beginning in the 1980s) to make them resemble a ""toy tiger"", as its striped coat is reminiscent of the tiger's. The breed's creator, Judy Sugden, has stated that the breed was developed in order to inspire people to care about the conservation of tigers in the wild. It was recognized for ""Registration only"" by The International Cat Association in the early 1990s, and advanced through all requirements to be accepted as a full Championship breed in 2007. There are now about twenty breeders in the United States and another 15 or so in the rest of the world.<sup id=""cite_ref-2"">
</sup>

The breed began development in the 1980s when Judy Sugden, a breeder looking to clarify the mackerel markings in tabbies, noticed distinctive markings in one of her cats. These tiny spots occurring on the temples of the face (an area normally devoid of distinct pattern) proved genetically that the circular tiger face pattern could be possible in a domestic cat. After importing a tom from the streets of India with noticeable spotting breaking up the usual tabby lines on the top of the head, the quest to develop a toy-tiger began in earnest. About forty domestic cats from various countries have been carefully selected over the years as founders; each providing the rudiments of a specific desirable trait that could then be expanded with careful breeding.

<h2>History</h2>
The <b>Turkish Angora</b>  is a breed of domestic cat. Turkish Angoras are one of the ancient, natural breedsof cat, having originated in central Turkey, in the Ankara region (historically known as Angora). The breed has been documented as early as the 1600s and is believed to be the origin of the mutations for both the coloration white (the dominant white gene is in truth the absence of color) and long hair. The breed is also sometimes referred to as simply the <b>Angora</b> or <b>Ankara cat</b>.

Like all domestic cats, Turkish Angoras descended from the African wildcat (<i>Felis silvestris lybica</i>). The Fertile Crescent was a place where cats were first domesticated. Cats from eastern mountainous regions of early Anatolia and through inbreeding and natural selection, developed into longhaired breeds like the Turkish Van and the Turkish Angora.<sup id=""cite_ref-1"">
</sup>

Longhaired cats were imported to Britain and France from Asia Minor, Persia and Russia as early as the late 16th century, though there are indications that they appeared in Europe as early as the 14th century due to the Crusades . The Turkish Angora was used, almost to the point of extinction, to improve the coat on the Persian. The Turkish Angora was recognized as a distinct breed in Europe by the 17th century.<sup id=""cite_ref-2"">
</sup>
<h2>Appearance</h2>
Turkish Angora cats have long, silky coats and elegant, sinuous bodies. Though it is known for a shimmery white coat, Turkish angora cats can display a variety of colors. They come in tabby and tabby-white, along with smoke varieties, and are in every color other than those that indicate hybridization (cross breeding), such as pointed, chocolate, lavender, and cinnamon.

Eyes may be blue, green, amber, yellow, or odd-eyed (e.g., one blue and one amber or green). Ears are pointed, large and wide-set. The eyes are almond shaped and the profile forms two straight planes. The plumed tail is often carried upright, perpendicular to the back.
<h2>Behavior</h2>
Turkish Angora cats are playful, intelligent, athletic and involved. They bond with humans, but often select a particular member of the family to be their constant companion. They are in turn, very protective of their person. They seek to be ""helpful"" in any way they can with their humans, and their intelligence is at times remarkable, showing basic problem solving skills. They are easily trained, including deaf Turkish Angoras, both because of their intelligence and their desire to interact with humans.

Turkish angoras are energetic, and often seek out ""high ground"" (or perch) in the home. This perch is then used as a way to observe activity of the home. This could include tops of doors, bookshelves, and other furniture. Some ride on their owners' shoulders. Their personality makes the breed desirable to certain people. They get along well in homes with other animals, children, and high activity.

<h2>History</h2>
The <b>Turkish Van</b>  is a longhaired breed of domestic cat with genetic origins in modern Turkey. The breed is commonly believed  to be descended from the landrace of Van cats, mostly found near Lake Van, though one of the two original breeders has stated that none of the original cats used to found the formal breed came from the Van area. The breed is thought to be rare, and is distinguished by the <i>Van</i> colour pattern, where the colour is restricted to the head and the tail, and the rest of the cat is white; this is due to the expression of the piebald white spotting gene, a type of partial leucism. A Van may have blue or amber eyes, or be odd-eyed, having one eye of each colour. The Turkish Van is nicknamed the <b>swimming cat</b>, but the idea that the breed likes water more than other cats may be mistaken. The breed was developed in Britain from a selection of Van cats obtained that came from various cities of Turkey. It was first recognised by a breeder/fancier organisation, the UK-based Governing Council of the Cat Fancy (GCCF), in 1969. The term ""<b>Turkish Vankedisi</b>"" is used by some organisations as a name for all-white specimens of the formal Turkish Van breed, and is easily confused with the landrace Van cat, the Turkish name of which is <i>Van kedisi</i>.

The coat on a Turkish Van is considered semi-longhaired. While many cats have three distinct hair types in their coat",NULL,NULL,,"Y","0"

<h2>History</h2>
The <b>Ukrainian Levkoy</b> is a cat breed of distinct appearance, having inward-folding ears and little to no hair. These cats are of medium size with a longish body, appearing both muscular and slender. They have soft, elastic skin; an excess of which leads to a wrinkled appearance. The breed is not recognized by any major, international cat fancier and breeder organizations, only Ukrainianand Russian clubs.

The Levkoy's peculiar features are: special angular contour of its head and ""stepped"" profile (dog-face appearance), folded ears and large, but not wide almond-shaped eyes. The cats express sexual dimorphism.<sup id=""cite_ref-1"">

<h2>History</h2>
The breed was created by Janet Chiefari in 1983. The father was a black longhaired cat and the mother was a longhaired black and white cat. Their Siamese ancestors created the brown coloring in one kitten: Brownie. Brownie had a litter that subsequent summer with a black longhaired tom. There were two kittens in the litter: a chocolate male and a white and chocolate female. Upon noticing similarities in coat and body types, Chiefari began her own breeding program.<sup>
</sup>

The breed is recognized, under the shorter name York, by the recently founded World Cat Federation based in Germany, and with some differences from previously published standards, most of which seem to be lost. The breed is not recognized by any major, long-established international cat fancier organizations, such as The International Cat Association (TICA), the Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA) or FǸdǸration Internationale FǸline (FIFe), nor even US national groups such as the American Cat Fanciers Association (ACFA). In March 1990, the Cat Fanciers' Federation of the New England area of the US recognized York Chocolates as an ""experimental"" cat breed, and allegedly gave it championship status within the group in March 1992, but publishes no breed standard or any other information about the breed today. It was supposedly granted champion status by the Canadian Cat Association in March 1995, as well, but while the CCA published a breed standard in 1995, as of March 2013, the organization no longer advertises it, and it includes outdated wording.<sup id=""cite_ref-CCA_no_std_6-0"">

An small breed club, the International York Chocolate Federation (IYCF) was founded in Italy, but seems to have been dormant since 2004. It claims affiliation with Feline Federation Europe (FFE), which since 2004 publishes a York Chocolate standard (missing the color information) and the World Felinological Federation (WFF), a Russian group, which does not recognize this breed

The name is derived from the German <i>Affe</i> (ape, monkey). The breed predates and is ancestral to the Griffon Bruxellois (Brussels Griffon) and Miniature Schnauzer.<sup id=""cite_ref-history_1-0""> </sup> Dogs of the Affenpinscher type have been known since about 1600, but these were somewhat larger, about 12 to 13 inches, and came in colors of gray, fawn, black and tan, gray and tan, and also red. White feet and chest were also common. The breed was created to be a ratter, working to remove rodents from kitchens, granaries, and stables. Banana Joe V Tani Kazari (AKA Joe), a five-year-old Affenpinscher, was named Best in Show at the 2013 Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show in New York City. This win is notable since it is the first time this breed has won Best in Show at Westminster. <h2>Description</h2> <h3>Appearance</h3> An Affenpinscher generally weighs 6.5 to 13.2 pounds (2.9 to 6.0 kg) and stands 9 to 12 inches (23 to 30 cm) tall at the withers.It has a harsh rough coat when it is not clippered and if clippered it can be softer and fluffier. It has a notable monkey-like expression (<i>Affe</i>means monkey in German). Its coat is shaggier over the head and shoulders forming a mane, with shorter coat over the back and hind quarters. It is harsh and wiry in texture when properly maintained. The FCI and KC breed standards specifies that the coat must be black,<sup id=""cite_ref-FCI_4-0"">[4]</sup><sup id=""cite_ref-KC-UK_5-0"">[5]</sup> but the AKC also allows grey, silver, red, black and tan, and belge (a mixture of red, brown, black and white hairs); other clubs have their own lists of acceptable colours, with black being the preference. <h2>Temperament</h2> Affenpinschers have a distinct appearance that some associate with terriers. They are different from terriers, however, in that they are actually part of the pinscher-schnauzer of group 2 in the FCI classification and so often get along with other dogs and pets. They are active, adventurous, curious, and stubborn, but they are also fun-loving and playful. The breed is confident, lively, affectionate towards family members and is also very protective of them. This loyal little dog enjoys being with its family. It needs consistent, firm training since some can be quite difficult to housebreak. This type of dog easily becomes bored, so training should be varied. The affenpinscher has a terrier-like personality. Affenpinschers are somewhat territorial when it comes to their toys and food, so they are not recommended for homes with very small children. This dog is mostly quiet, but can become very excited if attacked or threatened, and shows no fear toward any aggressor. It is best suited for a family who likes a show and has a sense of humor. <h2>Health</h2> <h3>Mortality</h3> A small sample (N=21) of affenpinschers in a UK survey had a median lifespan of 11.4 years, which is a typical lifespan for a purebred dog, but a bit lower than most breeds of their size.<sup id=""cite_ref-Cassidy_Weight_8-0"">[8]</sup> The most common causes of death were old age (24%), urologic (19%), and ""combinations"" (14%). Some are prone to fractures, slipped stifle, pda, open fontanel and respiratory problems in hot weather. <h3>Morbidity</h3> The affenpinscher is prone to hip dysplasia. As with many small breeds of dog, they are prone to collapsed trachea and luxating patella.Cataracts are occasionally reported.  An emerging concern is syringomyelia, although the incidence is currently unknown.<sup id=""cite_ref-12""> </sup> <h2>Shedding</h2> Affenpinschers often appear on lists of dogs that allegedly do not shed (moult).However, every hair shaft in the dog coat grows from a hair follicle. Each shaft has a cycle of growing, then dying and being replaced by another shaft. When the hair shaft dies, the hair is shed. The length of time of the growing and shedding cycle varies by breed, age, and by whether the dog is an inside or outside dog. Frequent grooming reduces the amount of loose fur in the environment.",NULL,NULL,NULL,"Y","0"

Today's modern purebred breed of Afghan Hound descends from dogs brought in the 1920s to Great Britain, and are a blending of types and varieties of long haired sighthounds from across Afghanistan and the surrounding areas.Some had been kept as hunting dogs, others as guardians.<sup id=""cite_ref-3""> </sup> Although demonstrably ancient, verifiable written or visual records that tie today's Afghan Hound breed to specific Afghan owners or places is absent, even though there is much speculation about possible connections with the ancient world among fanciers and in non-scientific breed books and breed websites. Connections with other types and breeds from the same area may provide clues to the history. A name for a desert coursing Afghan hound, Tazi (sag-e-tazi), suggests a shared ancestry with the very similar Tasy breed from the Caspian Sea area of Russia and Turkmenistan.Other types or breeds of similar appearance are the Taigan from the mountainous Tian Shan region on the Chinese border of Afghanistan, and the Barakzay, or Kurram Valley Hound. There are at least 13 types known in Afghanistan, and some are being developed (through breeding and record keeping) into modern purebred breeds.As the lives of the peoples with whom these dogs developed change in the modern world, often theselandrace types of dogs lose their use and disappear; there may have been many more types of longhaired sighthound in the past. Once out of Afghanistan, the history of the Afghan Hound breed becomes an important part of the history of the very earliest dog shows and The Kennel Club (UK). Various sighthounds were brought to England in the 1800s by army officers returning from British India (which at the time included), Afghanistan, and Persia, and were exhibited at dog shows, which were then just becoming popular, under various names, such as Barukzy hounds.They were also called ""Persian Greyhounds"" by the English, in reference to their own indigenous sighthound.<!--more--> Out of the longhaired sighthound types known in Afghanistan, two main strains make up the modern Afghan Hound breed. The first were a group of hounds brought to Scotland from Baluchistan by Major and Mrs. G. Bell-Murray and Miss Jean C. Manson in 1920, and are called the <i>Bell-Murray strain</i>. These dogs were of the lowland or steppe type, also called kalagh, and are less heavily coated. The second strain was a group of dogs from a kennel in Kabul owned by Mrs. Mary Amps, which she shipped to England in 1925. She and her husband came to Kabul after the Afghan war in 1919, and the foundation sire of her kennel (named Ghazni) in Kabul was a dog that closely resembled Zardin. Her <i>Ghazni strain</i> were the more heavily coated mountain type. Most of the Afghans in the United States were developed from the Ghazni strain from England. The first Afghans in Australia were imported from the United States in 1934, also of the Ghazni strain. The French breed club was formed in 1939 (FALAPA). The mountain and steppe strains became mixed into the modern Afghan Hound breed, and a new standard was written in 1948, which is still used today. The spectacular beauty of Afghan Hound dogs caused them to become highly desirable showdogs and pets, and they are recognised by all of the major kennel clubs in the English-speaking world. One of the Amps Ghazni, <i>Sirdar</i>, won BIS at Crufts in 1928 and 1930. An Afghan hound was featured on the cover of Life Magazine, November 26, 1945. ""Afghan Hounds were the most popular in Australia in the 1970s?and won most of the major shows"". An Afghan Hound won BIS (Best in Show) at the 1996 World Dog Show in Budapest. Afghan hounds were BIS at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show in 1957 and again in 1983. That win also marked the most recent win at Westminster for breeder-owner-handler, Chris Terrell. The Afghan Hound breed is no longer used for hunting, although it can be seen in the sport of lure coursing.<sup id=""cite_ref-10""> </sup> <h2>Descriptions</h2> <div> <div>This Afghan hound is black and brindle; however, the photo shows it with a reddish tinge to the coat, which can occur in a black-coated dog.</div> </div> The Afghan Hound is tall, standing in height 24?29 inches and weighing 45?60 pounds. The coat may be any colour, but white markings, particularly on the head, are discouraged; many individuals have a black facial mask. A specimen may have facial hair that looks like a Fu Manchu moustache. The moustache is called ""mandarins."" Some Afghan Hounds are almost white, but parti-colour hounds (white with islands of red or black) are not acceptable and may indicate impure breeding. The long, fine-textured coat requires considerable care and grooming. The long topknot and the shorter-haired saddle on the back of the dog are distinctive features of the Afghan Hound coat. The high hipbones and unique small ring on the end of the tail are also characteristics of the breed.<!--more--> The temperament of the typical Afghan Hound can be aloof and dignified, but happy and clownish when it's playing. This breed, as is the case with many sighthounds, has a high prey drive and may not get along with small animals. The Afghan Hounds' reasoning skills have made it a successful competitor in dog agility trials as well as an intuitive therapy dog and companion. Genomic studies have pointed to the Afghan Hound as one of the oldest of dog breeds.<sup id=""cite_ref-11""> </sup> The breed has a reputation among some dog trainers of having a relatively slow ""obedience intelligence"" as defined by author Stanley Coren in <i>The Intelligence of Dogs</i>. Although seldom used today for hunting in Europe and America where they are popular, Afghan hounds are frequent participants in lure coursing events and are also popular in thesport of conformation showing. <h2>Variants</h2> The Khalag Tazi is a variety of the Afghan. It was introduced to Europe in 1920 when an Indian Army officer, Major G Bell-Murray, brought some animals back fromAfghanistan. <i>Tazi</i> is a current and ancient name for hunting dogs of the sighthound type in the Middle East. It has been used to denote the Saluki, Afghan, Taigan,Persian Greyhound, greyhound types of hound. <h2>Health</h2> <div>Afghan Hound</div> <h3>Lifespan</h3> Afghan Hounds in UK surveys had a median lifespan of about 12 years which is similar to other breeds of their size. In the 2004 UK Kennel Club survey, the most common causes of death were cancer (31%), old age (20%), cardiac (10.5%), and urologic (5%). Those that die of old age had an average lifespan of 13 to 14 1/2 years.<sup id=""cite_ref-KC_Survey_15-0""> </sup> <h3>Health concerns</h3> Major health issues are allergies, cancer, and hip dysplasia. Sensitivity to anesthesia is an issue the Afghan hound shares with the rest of the sighthound group, as sighthounds have relatively low levels of body fat. Afghan hounds are also among the dog breeds most likely to develop chylothorax, a rare condition which causes the thoracic ducts to leak, allowing large quantities of chyle fluid to enter the dog's chest cavity. This condition commonly results in a lung torsion (in which the dog's lung twists within the chest cavity, requiring emergency surgery), due to the breed's typically deep, ""barrel""-shaped chest. If not corrected through surgery, chylothorax can ultimately cause fibrosing pleuritis, or a hardening of the organs, due to scar tissue forming around the organs to protect them from the chyle fluid. Chylothorax is not necessarily, but often, fatal. <h2>In popular culture</h2> Because of its distinctive appearance, the Afghan hound has been represented in animated feature films, including Universal Pictures'<i>Balto</i> (Sylvie), Disney's <i>Lady and the Tramp II</i> (Ruby), an Afghan hound also appeared on <i>101 Dalmatians</i> as well as in <i>102 Dalmatians</i>as one of the dogs in Cruella De Vil's party and the television series What-a-Mess (Prince Amir of Kinjan; based on children's books byFrank Muir) and, as Prissy in the 1961 Disney animated film <i>One Hundred and One Dalmatians</i> and <i>101 Dalmatians II: Patch's London Adventure</i>. Afghan hounds have also been featured in television advertisements and in fashion magazines. The Afghan hound is represented in books as well, including being featured in a series of mystery novels by Nina Wright (Abra), and a talking Afghan Hound in David Rothman's <i>The Solomon Scandals</i> (2008, Twilight Times Books). In the novel <i>Between the Acts</i>, Virginia Woolf uses an Afghan hound (named Sohrab) to represent aspects of one of the book's human characters.<sup id=""cite_ref-18""> </sup> On August 3, 2005, Korean scientist Hwang Woo-Suk announced that his team of researchers had become the first team to successfully clone a dog, an Afghan Hound named Snuppy. In 2006 Hwang Woo-Suk was dismissed from his university position for fabricating data in his research. Snuppy, nonetheless, was a genuine clone, and thus the first cloned dog in history.<sup id=""cite_ref-19""> </sup> In the BBC Three Sitcom <i>Mongrels</i> the character of Destiny is an Afghan Hound.

It is traditionally called the ""King of Terriers"" because it is the largest of the terrier breeds. Bred from a Welsh Terrier and an Otterhound, the breed has also been called the <b>Waterside Terrier</b>, because it was bred originally to hunt otters in and around the valleys of the River Aire which runs through Airedale. In the United Kingdom this breed has also been used as a police dog. <h2>Description</h2> <h3>Appearance</h3> The Airedale is the largest of the British Terriers. They weigh 25?30 kilograms (55?66 lb) and have a height at the withers of 58?61 centimetres (23?24 in) for dogs, with females slightly smaller. The American Kennel Club standard specifies a smaller dog. Larger Airedales, up to 55 kilograms (120 lb) can be found in North America. They are often called ""Oorangs."" This was the name of a kennel in Ohio in the early 1900s.<sup id=""cite_ref-whatis_2-0""> </sup> The Airedale has a medium-length black and tan coat with a harsh topcoat and a soft undercoat. They are an alert and energetic breed, ""not aggressive but fearless."" It has been claimed that the large ""hunting"" type or Oorang Airedales are more game than the smaller ""show"" type Airedales. The large type are usually used for big game hunting and as family guardians or as pets, but usually do poorly in AKC conformation shows. This larger type is also significantly more prone to Hip Dysplasia than the standard Airedales. <h4>Coat</h4> Like many terriers, the breed has a 'broken' coat. The coat is hard and wiry. The coat is meant to be kept not so long as to appear ragged, and lies straight and close, covering body and legs. The outer coat is hard, wiry and stiff. Airedales may have an undercoat which is softer. The hardest coats are crinkling or just slightly waved. Curly soft coats are highly undesirable. Airedales bearing undercoats are generally groomed by <i>hand stripping</i> where a small serrated edged knife is used to pull out loose hair from the dog's coat.Most Airedales require frequent shaving and do not shed. The AKC breed standard states that the correct coat color is either a black saddle, with a tan head, ears and legs; or a dark grizzle saddle (black mixed with gray and white). There are, however, examples of non-standard black-coated and ""red"" (tan) coated Airedales, (the solid colored Airedales are NOT able to be AKC registered, since they are deviations from breed standard even though purebred.) There are also the short coated ""Redline"" type Airedales, they appear to be genetic throwbacks in looks to the Airedale's early days when the breed's coats were much shorter than today's Airedale. Even with their shorter coat they still have the same hard wiry outer coat with a soft under coat and fall well within the criteria of the breed standard and therefore can be AKC registered and most are registered. <h4>Tail</h4> Traditionally the fluffy tail is long and erect. In the UK it is illegal to dock dogs' tails unless it is for the dog's benefit (e.g., if the tail is broken). In other parts of the world the Airedale's tail is commonly docked (surgically shortened) within five days of birth, but this is not considered a breed standard custom. To show an Airedale in the United States, the official AKC standard states ""The root of the tail should be set well up on the back. It should be carried gaily but not curled over the back. It should be of good strength and substance and of fair length."" <h4>Size</h4> Airedales weigh approximately 50 - 70 pounds, being active and agile enough to perform well, while not too small to function as a physical deterrent, retriever or hunter. Some breeders have produced larger Airedale Terriers, such as the 'Oorang Airedale', developed in the 1920s.<sup id=""cite_ref-dogdom_4-0"">[4]</sup> Ex-Army captain and Airdale breeder Walter Lingo's monthly magazine ""Oorang Comments"" (#25, page 81), stated that ""When full grown your Airedale dog will weigh from forty to fifty-five pounds and if a female will weigh slightly less. This is the standard weight, but when required, we can furnish over-sized Airedales whose weight will be from sixty to one hundred pounds."" Because Lingo tried to fill orders for everyone, the Oorang strain size was never standardized. Airedales weighing from 40 to 100 pounds were produced, but for the most part they were approximately 50 pounds and 22 to 24 inches at the shoulder. <h3>Temperament</h3> The Airedale can be used as a working dog and also as a hunting dog. Airedales exhibit some herding characteristics as well, and have a propensity to chase animals. They have no problem working with cattle and livestock. However, an Airedale that is not well trained will agitate and annoy the animals. The Airedale Terrier, like most Terriers, has been bred to hunt independently. As a result, the dog is very intelligent, independent, strong-minded, stoic, and can sometimes be stubborn. If children and Airedale are both trained correctly, Airedales can be an excellent choice for a family dog. Airedales can do well with cats and other small animals, especially when they are raised with them. Albert Payson Terhune wrote of the Airedale: ""Among the mine-pits of the Aire, the various groups of miners each sought to develop a dog which could outfight and outhunt and outthink the other miner's dogs. Tests of the first-named virtues were made in inter-mine dog fights. Bit by bit, thus, an active, strong, heroic, compactly graceful and clever dog was evolved ? the earliest true form of the Airedale. He is swift, formidable, graceful, big of brain, an ideal chum and guard. ....To his master he is an adoring pal. To marauders he is a destructive lightning bolt."" <h2>Health</h2> Airedale Terriers in UK, USA, and Canadian surveys had a median lifespan of about 11.5 years, which is similar to other breeds of their size.<sup id=""cite_ref-Cassidy_Weight_6-0""> </sup> In a 2004 UK Kennel Club survey, the most common causes of death were cancer (39.5%), old age (14%), urologic (9%), and cardiac (7%). In a 2000?2001 USA/Canada Health Survey, the most common causes of death were cancer (38%), urologic (17%), old age (12%), and cardiac (6%) A very hardy breed, although some may suffer from eye problems, hip dysplasia and skin infections. Airedales can be affected by hip dysplasia. Like most terriers, they have a propensity towards dermatitis. Skin disorders may go unnoticed in Airedales, because of their hard, dense, wiry coats. Itchy skin may be manifest as acral lick dermatitis (also known as lick granuloma; caused by licking one area excessively) or acute moist dermatitis or ""hot spots"" (an oppressively itchy, inflamed and oozing patch of skin, made worse by intense licking and chewing). Allergies, dietary imbalances, and under/over-productive thyroid glands are the main causes of skin conditions. An Airedale's coat was originally designed to protect the dog from its predators?the coat was designed to come out in the claws of the predator the dog was designed to hunt, leaving the dog unharmed. Because of this, some forms of skin dermatitis can respond to hand stripping the coat. Clipping the coat cuts the dead hair, leaving dead roots within the hair follicles. It is these dead roots which can cause skin irritations. However, hand stripping removes these dead roots from the skin and stimulates new growth. Hence this process can assist with some forms of skin irritations. Gastric torsion, or bloat, affects Airedale Terriers. Bloat can turn and block the stomach, causing a buildup of gas. Bloat can be fatal, it can lead to cardiovascular collapse. Signs of bloat are gastric distress (stomach pain), futile attempts at vomiting, and increased salivation. Bloat usually occurs when the dog is exercised too soon after eating. They will eat up to 4-6 cups of food at a time.

In the mid-19th Century, working class people created the Airedale Terrier by crossing the old English rough-coated Black and Tan Terrier (now known as the Welsh Terrier) with the Otterhound. In 1886, the Kennel Club of England formally recognized the Airedale Terrier breed. In 1864 they were exhibited for the first time at a championship dog show sponsored by the Airedale Agricultural Society. They were classified under different names, including Rough Coated, Bingley and Waterside Terrier. In 1879 breed fanciers decided to call the breed the Airedale Terrier, a name accepted by the Kennel Club (England) in 1886. Well-to-do hunters of the era were typically accompanied by a pack of hounds and several terriers, often running them both together. The hounds would scent and pursue the quarry and the terriers would ""go to ground"" or enter into the quarry's burrow and make the kill. Terriers were often the sporting dog of choice for the common man. Early sporting terriers needed to be big enough to tackle the quarry, but not so big as to prevent them from maneuvering through the quarry's underground lair. As a result, these terriers had to have a very high degree of courage and pluck to face the foe in a tight, dark underground den without the help of human handlers. During the middle of the nineteenth century, regular sporting events took place along the Aire River in which terriers pursued the large river rats that inhabited the area. A terrier was judged on its ability to locate a ""live"" hole in the riverbank and then, after the rat was driven from its hole by a ferret brought along for that purpose, the terrier would pursue the rat through water until it could make a kill. As these events became more popular, demand arose for a terrier that could excel in this activity. One such terrier was developed through judicious crossings of the Black-and-Tan Terrier and Bull and Terrier dogs popular at the time with the Otter Hound. The result was a long-legged fellow that would soon develop into the dog we recognize today as the Airedale Terrier. This character was too big to ""go to ground"" in the manner of the smaller working terriers; however, it was good at everything else expected of a sporting terrier, and it was particularly adept at water work. This big terrier had other talents in addition to its skill as a ratter. Because of its hound heritage it was blessed with the ability to scent game and the size to be able to tackle larger animals. It became more of a multipurpose terrier that could pursue game by powerful scenting ability, be broken to gun, and taught to retrieve. Its size and temperament made it an able guardian of farm and home. One of the colorful, but less-than legal, uses of the early Airedale Terrier was to assist its master in poaching game on the large estates that were off-limits to commoners. Rabbits, hare, and fowl were plentiful, and the Airedale could be taught to retrieve game killed by its master, or to pursue, kill, and bring it back itself. The first imports of Airedale Terriers to North America were in the 1880s. The first Airedale to come to American shores was named Bruce. After his 1881 arrival, Bruce won the terrier class in a New York dog show. The patriarch of the breed is considered to be CH Master Briar (1897?1906). Two of his sons, Crompton Marvel and Monarch, also made important contributions to the breed.<sup id=""cite_ref-ukstandard_9-0""> </sup> The first Canadian registrations are recorded in the Stud book of 1888?1889. In 1910, the ATCA (Airedale Terrier Club of America) offered the Airedale Bowl as a perpetual trophy, which continues to this day. It is now mounted on a hardwood pedestal base, holding engraved plates with the names of the hundreds of dogs that have been awarded Best of Breed at the National Specialties. The Airedale was extensively used in World War I to carry messages to soldiers behind enemy lines and transport mail. They were also used by the Red Cross to find wounded soldiers on the battlefield. There are numerous tales of Airedales delivering their messages despite terrible injury. An Airedale named 'Jack' ran through half a mile of enemy fire, with a message attached within his collar. He arrived at headquarters with his jaw broken and one leg badly splintered, and right after he delivered the message, he dropped dead in front of its recipient.<sup id=""cite_ref-history_10-0""> </sup><sup id=""cite_ref-11""></sup> Lieutenant Colonel Edwin Hautenville Richardson was responsible for the development of messenger and guard dogs in the British Army. He, along with his wife, established theBritish War Dog School at Shoeburyness in Essex, England. In 1916, they provided two Airedales (Wolf &amp; Prince)for use as message carriers. After both dogs proved themselves in battle, Airedales were given more duties, such as locating injured soldiers on the battlefield, an idea taken from the Red Cross. Before the adoption of the German Shepherd as the dog of choice for law enforcement and search and rescue work, the Airedale terrier often filled this role. In 1906, Richardson tried to interest the British Police in using dogs to accompany officers, for protection on patrol at night. Mr. Geddes, Chief Goods Manager for Hull Docks in Yorkshire, was convinced after he went and saw the impressive work of police dogs in Belgium. Geddes convinced Superintendent Dobie of the North Eastern Railway Police, to arrange a plan for policing the docks. Airedale Terriers were selected for duty as police dogs because of their intelligence, good scenting abilities and their hard, wiry coats that were easy to maintain and clean. At the beginning of the Russo-Japanese war in 1904, the Russian embassy in London contacted Lt. Colonel Richardson for help acquiring dogs for the Russian Army, trained to take the wounded away from the battlefields. He sent terriers, mostly Airedale Terriers, for communication and sanitary services. Although these original imports perished, Airedale Terriers were reintroduced to Russia in the early 1920s for use by the Red Army. Special service dog units were created in 1923, and Airedale Terriers were used as demolition dogs, guard dogs, police tracking dogs and casualty dogs. <sup id=""cite_ref-12""> </sup> Two Airedales were among the dogs lost with the sinking of the RMS Titanic. The Airedale ""Kitty"" belonged to Colonel John Jacob Astor IV, the real-estate mogul. The second Airedale belonged to William E. Carter of Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania. Mr. Carter was the owner of the Renault automobile in which Jack and Rose trysted in the movie ""Titanic"". Carter, his wife and two children survived the sinking. During the 1930s, when airedales were farmed like livestock, American breeders developed the Oorang airedale. Capt. Walter Lingo, of LaRue, Ohio, developed the Oorang Airedale strain. The name came from a line of bench champions, headed by King Oorang 11, a dog which was said to have been the finest utility dog. King could retrieve waterfowl and upland game, tree raccoons, drive cattle and sheep, and bay mountain lions, bears, and wolves. King even fought one of the best fighting bull terriers, and killed his opponent. He also trained in Red Cross work, and served the American Expeditionary Force at the front in France. Lingo simply wasn't satisfied with the average strain of Airedale, and after an incredible series of breedings, for which he brought in great Airedales from all over the world, he created the ""King Oorang."" At the time, Field and Stream magazine called it, ""the greatest utility dog in the history of the world."" The Oorang Kennel Company continued until Walter Lingo's death in 1969. To help promote the King Oorang, as well as his kennels, Lingo created the Oorang Indians football team headed up by Jim Thorpe. The team played in National Football League from 1922?1923.<sup id=""cite_ref-13"">[13]</sup> Jerry Siebert, an Airedale breeder in Buckeye Lake, Ohio, followed in Lingo's footsteps, and bred ""Jerang Airedales."" There is a kennel in Tennessee that claims to have original Oorang Airedales.<sup id=""cite_ref-whatis_2-1""> </sup> After the First World War, the Airedales' popularity rapidly increased thanks to stories of their bravery on the battlefield and also because Presidents Theodore Roosevelt, Calvin Coolidge, and Warren Harding owned Airedales. President Harding's Airedale, Laddie Boy, was the ""first celebrity White House pet"".<sup id=""cite_ref-14"">[14]</sup> President Harding had a special chair hand carved for him to sit on at very important Cabinet meetings. In the 1920s, the Airedale became the most popular breed in the USA. President Roosevelt claimed that ""An Airedale can do anything any other dog can do and then lick the other dog, if he has to."" 1949 marked the peak of the Airedales' popularity in the USA, ranked 20th out of 110 breeds recognized by the American Kennel Club.

There are approximately 1500 Alaskan Klee Kais in the world. <h2>History</h2> The breed was developed in Wasilla, Alaska, from the early 1970s to 1988 by Linda S. Spurlin and her family.The breed was developed with Siberian and Alaskan Huskies using Schipperke and American Eskimo Dog to bring down the size without dwarfism. She bred these dogs in private until she released them to the general public in 1988. Originally called the <i>Klee Kai</i>, the breed split into<i>Alaskan Klee Kai</i> and <i>Klee Kai</i> for political reasons in 1995. The breed consolidated as its current name in 2002.

They are similar to other arctic breeds, like the Canadian Eskimo Dog, the Siberian Husky and the Samoyed. The American Kennel Club (AKC) breed standard describes a natural range of size, with a desired size of 23 inches (58 cm) tall and 75 pounds (34 kg) for females, 25 inches (64 cm) tall and 85 pounds (39 kg) for males. Heavier individuals (90 lb (41 kg)) and dogs smaller than 75 pounds (34 kg) are commonly seen. There is often a marked size difference between males and females. Weights upwards of 100 pounds (45 kg) are also seen. <sup id=""cite_ref-1""> </sup> The coat of the Alaskan Malamute is a double coat. The undercoat has an oily and woolly texture and can be as thick as two inches.  The outer guard coat is coarse and stands off the body?longer at the withers but not more than one inch off the sides of the body. Ears are small in proportion to the head and stand firmly erect when at attention. The Alaskan Malamute is a brown-eyed, heavy dog, with a more formidable nature and structure than the Siberian Husky, which is a dog of small and slim stature, having blue, brown, or bi-eyes, and which is fine-boned, being specifically bred for speed, which is why they are most used in various competitions. The Alaskan Malamute is bred for power and endurance, which is its original function and what the standard of the breed requires of Alaskan Malamute breeders.<!--more--> The usual colors are various shades of gray and white, sable and white, black and white, seal and white, red and white, or solid white.  There are a wide range of markings in the breed including face markings, blazes, a splash at the nape of the neck, a collar or a half collar. In terms of color variants, some Malamutes exhibit a dark grey to buff-colored undertone around their trimmings and white areas, presenting with a color-linked gene known as 'Agouti'. The eyes of the Alaskan Malamute are almond-shaped and are varied shades of brown; however, the darker eye is preferred. The physical build of the Malamute is compact and strong with substance, bone and snowshoe feet. According to the AKC breed standard, the Malamute's tail is well furred and is carried over the back like a ""waving plume"". Corkscrew tails are occasionally seen but are faulted in the AKC breed standard (a corkscrew tail is commonly seen in the Akita). The Malamutes' well-furred tails aid in keeping them warm when they curl up in the snow. They are often seen wrapping the tail around their nose and face, which presumably helps protect them against harsh weather such as blowing snow. Their ears are generally upright, wedge-shaped, small in proportion to the head and set to the side of the skull. The muzzle is deep and broad, tapering slightly from the skull to the nose. Nose and gums are black but some Malamutes have a snow nose, which is black with a pink undertone that can get darker or lighter, depending on the season. <h2>Temperament</h2> Alaskan Malamutes are still in use as sled dogs for personal travel, hauling freight, or helping move light objects; some however are used for the recreational pursuit of sledding, also known as mushing, as well as for skijoring, bikejoring, carting, and canicross. However, most Malamutes today are kept as family pets or as show or performance dogs in weight pulling, dog agility, or packing. Malamutes are generally slower in long-distance dogsled racing against smaller and faster breeds and their working usefulness is limited to freighting or traveling over long distances at a far slower rate than that required for racing. They can also help move heavy objects over shorter distances. An adult male Alaskan Malamute can pull at least 1,000-3,000 pounds of mass, depending on how well structured and well trained it is. They are also very intelligent animals, though they can be hard to train. The Malamute retains more of its original form and function than many other modern breeds. The Malamute personality is one of strong independence. If a dog owner cannot cope with a dog that will not comply with the owner's every command, a more compliant breed should be selected. This dog has a long genetic foundation of living in the harshest environment imaginable, and many of its behaviors are evolved to survive in such environments. Independence, resourcefulness, and natural behaviors are common in the breed. Because of their intelligence, they can be difficult dogs to train. However, if the trainer understands Malamutes and how to keep them motivated, success is possible. Malamutes sometimes cope poorly with smaller animals, including other canines; however, this has been difficult to document in detail beyond observational data. Many Malamute owners have observed this behavior with smaller animals. Due to their naturally evolved beginnings, Malamutes tend to have natural hunting instincts which often leads them to chase smaller animals, such as rabbits, squirrels, and cats. So while Malamutes are, as a general rule, particularly amicable around people and can be taught to tolerate other pets, it is necessary to be mindful of them around smaller animals. Malamutes are quite fond of people, a trait that makes them particularly sought-after family dogs but unreliable watchdogs. Malamutes are nimble around furniture and smaller items, making them ideal house dogs, provided they get plenty of time outdoors meeting their considerable exercise requirements.If they are year-round outdoor dogs, letting them play in a baby pool filled with cold water in summer keeps them cool. In the winter, they love snow. Malamutes are usually quiet dogs, seldom barking. When a Malamute does vocalize, it often appears to be ""talking"" by vocalizing a ""woo woo"" sound. It may howl like a wolf orcoyote, and for the same reason.

The median lifespan of 10.7 years measured in that survey is typical of a breed their size, however this study had too small of a sample size to be considered reliable and much anecdotal evidence suggests they have on average one of the longest lifespans of large dogs, up to 15 years.The major cause of death was cancer (36%). The most commonly reported health problems of Alaskan Malamutes, in the 2004 UK Kennel Club survey (based on a sample size of 64 dogs) were musculoskeletal (hip dysplasia), and hereditary cataracts. There are additional health issues in the breed whose origins are unknown at this time including varied seizure disorders found in young puppies as well as adults, Epilepsy, congenital heart problems, kidney problems and skin disorders. Other health issues in Malamutes include Elbow dysplasia, inherited polyneuropathy, chondrodysplasia, heart defects, and eye problems (particularly cataract and progressive retinal atrophy). A growing problem among arctic dog breeds, including the Alaskan Malamute, but especially their cousin, the Samoyed, is canine diabetes with onset occurring typically in middle age (5 to 7 years).<sup id=""cite_ref-ADRTC_9-0""> </sup> <h2>History</h2> In some accounts, the Alaskan Malamute is described as a descendant of dogs of the Mahlemut (now known as Kuuvangmiut or more commonly Kobuk) group of Inupiat in upper western Alaska. These dogs had a prominent role with their human companions ? as a utilitarian dog, working, hunting, and living alongside humans.The dogs were renowned for their excellent hunting abilities and were used to hunt large predators such as bears. They also aided their owners in finding seals by alerting to seal blow holes. The interdependent relationship between the Mahlemut and their dogs fostered prosperity among both and enabled them to flourish in the inhospitable land above the Arctic Circle. For a brief period during the Klondike Gold Rush of 1896, the Malamute and other sled dogs became extremely valuable to recently landed prospectors and settlers, and were frequently crossbred with imported breeds. This was often an attempt to improve the type, or to make up for how few true Malamutes were available to purchase. This seems to have had no long-standing effect on the modern Malamute, and 2004 DNA analysis shows that Malamutes are one of the oldest breeds of dog, genetically distinct from other dog breeds.A study in 2013 showed that the Alaskan Malamute has a similar east Asian origin to, but is not clearly related to, the Greenland Dog and the Inuit Sled Dog (Canadian Eskimo Dog), but contains a possible admixture of the Siberian Husky. <sup id=""cite_ref-13""> </sup> The Malamute dog has had a distinguished history; aiding Rear Admiral Richard Byrd to the South Pole, and the miners who came to Alaska during the Gold Rush of 1896, as well as serving in World War II primarily as search and rescue dogs in Greenland, although also used as freighting and packing dogs in Europe. This dog was never destined to be a racing sled dog; it was used for heavy freighting, pulling hundreds (maybe thousands) of pounds of supplies to villages and camps in groups of at least 4 dogs for heavy loads. The Alaskan Malamute is a member of the Spitz group of dogs, traced back 2,000 to 3,000 years ago to the Mahlemuits tribe of Alaska. In 2010 the Alaskan Malamute was named the official state dog of Alaska.<sup id=""cite_ref-14""><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaskan_Malamute#cite_note-14""> </a></sup><sup id=""cite_ref-15""></sup> [button link=""http://alphamatch.com/listing-type/pets/?pet-type=1081&amp;breed-2=1035"" color=""black"" type=""big-button"" type=""Search for Alaskan Malamute""]Search for Alaskan Malamute[/button]",NULL,NULL,NULL,"Y","0"

The spaniel was a large dog notable for its thick curly coat. One of the most famous specimens of the Alpine Spaniel is Barry, however his preserved body has been modified on more than one occasion to fit with descriptions of the extinct breed from earlier time periods. Due to the conditions in the Alps, and a series of accidents, extinction was discussed as a possibility by authors during the 1830s, and at some point prior to 1847 the entire breed was reduced to a single example due to disease. Evidence held at the Natural History Museum in Bern show that two distinct breeds of dog were being used in the area during this time period. The breed is thought to be the predecessor to the modern St. Bernard and the Clumber Spaniel. <h2>Description</h2> The Alpine was a large breed of spaniel, described as reaching two feet at the withers and six feet from the nose to the tail.<sup id=""cite_ref-bio278_2-0"">[2]</sup> It had a closely set coat, curlier than that of the English Cocker Spaniel or the English Springer Spaniel.

However during the preservation, the taxidermist and the director of the Museum agreed to modify the body towards what they thought was a good example of the breed during that period. The head itself was further modified in 1923 to represent the Saint Bernard of that era. Prior to this the skull was a great deal flatter with a moderate stop.<sup id=""cite_ref-8""> </sup> In 1829 a Mastiff like dog was brought from the Great St Bernard Hospice and was exhibited in London and Liverpool to thousands of people.

However at some point prior to 1847 a pestilence swept through the region and reduced the number down to a single specimen, which forced the canons into crossing it with other breeds.<sup id=""cite_ref-richardson_9-1""> </sup> <h2>Legacy</h2> <div style=""display: inline !important;""></div> <div>A drawing of the Alpine Spaniel in 1848, 18 years after they were first crossed with the Newfoundland</div> <h3>St. Bernard</h3> The Alpine Spaniel was one of the direct genetic progenitors to the St. Bernard.Starting in 1830, the monks and canons of the Swiss Alps began crossing the dogs with the Newfoundland, expecting that the resulting offspring would have the longer hair of the Newfoundland and this would protect the dogs better from the cold. Unfortunately ice would form on the longer hair, and seeing that the dogs were no longer effective rescue dogs, the monasteries gave them away to people in the surrounding Swiss valleys.<sup id=""cite_ref-smith_12-0""> </sup> In 1855 a stud book was opened for these crosses, which supplied the hospice with suitable dogs and also exported the dogs overseas.

Colors, while historically predominantly white with patches of red, black, or brindle, have grown in recent years to include many color patterns including black, red, brown, fawn, and all shades of brindle. The color conformation is quite varied, but solid black or any degree of merle is considered a cosmetic fault, and a blue color is a disqualification by the NKC Breed Standard. Black pigmentation on the nose and eye rims is preferred, with only some pink allowed. <!--more-->Eye color is usually brown, but heterochromia also occurs, although considered a cosmetic fault. American Bulldogs can be droolers; this varies and is more prevalent in the Bully type, which is generally a larger, heavier dog with a shorter muzzle. Standard or Performance types are generally more athletic with longer muzzles and a more square head. It is important to note that many modern American Bulldogs are a combination of the two types usually termed ""hybrid."" In general, American Bulldogs weigh between 27 to 54 kg (60 to 120 lb) and are 52 to 70 cm (20 to 28 in) at the withers, but have been known to greatly exceed these dimensions, especially in the ""out of standard,"" nonworking stock.

It is not uncommon for an American Bulldog to require a high level of attention due to their highly emotional personality. They bond strongly with their owners. They are capable of jumping in excess of seven feet vertical due to the dense muscle build of the breed. Young American Bulldogs may be slightly aloof with strangers, but as they mature the breed's normal confidence should assert itself. This breed tolerates children and can do very well with them, provided they are socialized early and understand their limits. <!--more-->The more exposure to good training practices, other dogs, and people, the more likely the success at being controlled both inside and outside of their environment. Early training and socialization both in the home and outside of the home is essential for this breed. One way to help accomplish this goal can be done in the simplest of ways: walking them regularly at local parks. While the goal of the breed was originally to produce a working farm utility dog that could catch and hold wild boar and cattle, kill vermin, and guard an owner's property, when properly trained, exercised and socialized, this breed can become a great family pet. <h2>History</h2> <h3>History in Spain and England</h3> Even the slight modifications the bulldog underwent in Spain and England up to the Industrial Revolution (before 1835), were absent in the working strains. Most settlers of the American South came from the West Midlands of England and emigrated as a result of the Civil War between Royalists and Parliamentarians, well before the Industrial Revolution).<!--more--> <h3>History in the United States</h3> The original bulldog was preserved by working class immigrants who brought their working dogs with them to the American South. Small farmers and ranchers used this all-around working dog for many tasks including farm guardians, stock dogs and catch dog. These dogs were not an actual breed as considered by today's standards but were a generic bulldog type. There were no recorded pedigrees or records and breeding decisions were dependent on the best working farm dogs despite breed or background. Several separate strains of the ""bulldog"" type dogs were kept by ranchers as utilitarian working dogs. Perhaps the most important role of the bulldog and the reason for its survival, and in fact why it thrived throughout the South, was because of the presence of feral pigs, introduced to the New World and without predators. The bulldogs were the settlers' only means of sufficiently dealing with the vermin. By World War II, the breed was near extinction until John D. Johnson and his father scoured the back roads of the South looking for the best specimens to revive the breed. During this time a young Alan Scott grew an interest in Mr. Johnson's dogs and began to work with him on the revitalization process. At some point, Alan Scott began infusing non-Johnson catch bulldogs from working Southern farms with John D. Johnson's line, creating the now Standard American Bulldog. At another point, Mr. Johnson began crossing his line with an atavistic English bulldog from the North that had maintained its genetic athletic vigor. <h3>Recent history</h3> American bulldogs are now safe from extinction and are enjoying a healthy increase in popularity, either as a working/protector dog or as a family pet. All over the world, they are used variously as ""hog dogs"" (catching escaped pigs or hunting razorbacks), as cattle drovers and as working or sport K-9s. American Bulldogs also successfully compete in several dog sports such as dog obedience, Schutzhund, French Ring, Mondio Ring, Iron Dog competition and weight pulling. They are also exhibited in conformation shows in the OREBA, UKC, NKC, ABA, ABRA and the SACBR (South Africa).

It is a spaniel type dog that is closely related to the English Cocker Spaniel; the two breeds diverged during the 20th century due to differing breed standards in America and the UK. In the United States, the breed is usually referred to as the <b>Cocker Spaniel</b>, while elsewhere in the world, it is called the American Cocker Spaniel in order to differentiate between it and its English cousin. The word <i>cocker</i> is commonly held to stem from their use to hunt woodcock in England, while <i>spaniel</i> is thought to be derived from the type's origins in Spain.<!--more--> The first spaniel in America came across with the Mayflower in 1620, but it was not until 1878 that the first Cocker Spaniel was registered with the American Kennel Club (AKC). A national breed club was set up three years later and the dog considered to be the father of the modern breed, Ch. Obo II, was born around this time. By the 1920s the English and American varieties of Cocker had become noticeably different and in 1946 the AKC recognised the English type as a separate breed. It was not until 1970 that The Kennel Club in the UK recognised the American Cocker Spaniel as being separate from the English type. The American Cocker was the most popular breed in the United States during the 1940s and 50s and again during the 1980s, reigning for a total of 18 years. They have also won the best in show title at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show on four occasions, and have been linked to thePresident of the United States on several occasions, with owners including Richard Nixon and Harry S. Truman. The breed is the smallest of the sporting dogs recognised by the AKC, and its distinctly shaped head makes it immediately recognisable. In addition, there are some marked differences between it and its English relative. It is a happy breed with average working intelligence, although by being bred to a show standard it is no longer an ideal working dog. Members of the breed suffer from a wide variety of health ailments including problems with their hearts, eyes and ears. <h2>History</h2> <div> <div> <div>Ch. Obo II, considered to be the foundation sire of the American Cocker Spaniel.</div> </div> </div> The word <i>spanyell</i> is thought to date from the late 1100s when it was used to name a type of dog imported into England from Spain, with the <i>span</i> part of the word referring to the country of origin. Records from the mid-1300s show that selective breeding was already in place, with the breed being separated into two distinct types, called water spaniels and land spaniels.By 1801, the smaller variety of land spaniel was referred to as the Cocker or Cocking Spaniel, so named for its use in flushing woodcock.<!--more--> According to historical records, the first spaniel was brought to North America aboard the <i>Mayflower</i> which sailed from Plymouth, England and landed in New England in 1620.The first Cocker Spaniel recorded in America was a liver and white dog named Captain, who was registered with the American Kennel Club in 1878.In 1881, the American Cocker Spaniel Club was formed; it would later become the American Spaniel Club (ASC) and is now known as the oldest breed club for dogs in the United States. The task of the club was initially to create a standard to separate the Cocker Spaniel in America from other types of land spaniels, a task which would take over 20 years, only being completed in 1905.<sup id=""cite_ref-walker7_4-2""> </sup> The dog considered to be the father of the American Cocker Spaniel was sired by the dog considered to be the father of the English Cocker Spaniel. Ch. Obo was bred to Ch. Chloe II, who was shipped to America while she was pregnant. Once in the United States, she whelped a dog who became Ch. Obo II. He differed greatly from the modern breed, being only 10 inches (25 cm) tall and with a long body, but was considered to be an excellent dog of that era and became a popular sire.<sup id=""cite_ref-palika21_6-2""> </sup> Towards the end of the 19th century, the breed had become popular in America and Canada due to their dual use as a family pet and a working dog.In the early 20th century the breeders on either side of the Atlantic had created different breed standards for the Cocker Spaniel and the breed gradually diverged from one another, with the two becoming noticeably different by the 1920s. The American Cockers by now had a smaller muzzle, their coats were softer and the dogs overall were lighter and smaller. The differences were so apparent that in 1935, breeders founded the English Cocker Spaniel Club and restricted breeding between the two types of spaniel. The two types of Cocker Spaniel in America were shown together as one breed, with the English type as a variety of the main breed, until 1946 when the American Kennel Club recognised the English Cocker Spaniel as a separate breed.<sup id=""cite_ref-walker8_7-1""> </sup><sup id=""cite_ref-palika22_8-0""></sup> <h3>Return to the UK</h3> <div style=""display: inline !important;""></div> <div>A black American Cocker Spaniel in a show cut.</div> Initially in the United Kingdom there were a few American Cockers that had accompanied service personnel to American bases in the 1950s and 1960s.

Steinberg. Two judges confirmed that the dog was an American Cocker and not an English Cocker before the Kennel Club permitted the dog to be shown. In the 1960s they were shown as a rare breed, which meant that they did not have a show class of their own and could only be shown in variety classes. This included Aramingo Argonaught, who was the first American Cocker Spaniel to be shown at Cruftsin 1960 in a class entitled ""Any variety not classified at this show"". In 1968, the KC agreed to have the breed shown in the category ""Any variety gundog other than Cocker"" and stated that the American Cocker was not a variety of ""Spaniel (Cocker)"". There were around 100 registrations between 1966 to 1968.<sup id=""cite_ref-amuk_9-1""> </sup> In 1970 the breed was given a separate register in the Kennel Club Breed Supplement, as it was previously included in ""Any other variety"".

Midkiff Seductive. Ch. My Own Brucie won the title twice in 1940 and 1941, and became known as the most photographed dog in the world.Brucie's win in 1940 coincided with the American Cocker Spaniel becoming the most popular breed of dog in the United States, and they would remain the most popular until 1952.The most recent victory was in 1954 with the victory going to Ch. Carmor's Rise and Shine. The popularity of the American Cocker increased once again in the 1980s with it becoming the most popular breed again from 1984 until 1990. In more recent years the popularity of the breed has decreased, with it ranked 15th most popular by the American Kennel Club in 2005.<!--more--><sup id=""cite_ref-coile11_14-0""> </sup> American Cocker Spaniels have had several links to the United States Presidency. In 1952, an American Cocker Spaniel became a household name when United States Senator Richard Nixon made his Checkers speech on 23 September. A parti-colored American Cocker Spaniel named Dot was one of several dogs owned by Rutherford B. Hayes; and a buff colored dog named Feller caused a scandal for Harry S. Truman when the dog was received as an unwanted gift with the President subsequently giving it away to a White House physician. More recently, a Cocker named Zeke lived with Bill Clinton while he was Arkansas Governor.<sup id=""cite_ref-coile10_13-1""> </sup> <h2>Appearance</h2> The American Cocker Spaniel is the smallest dog recognised by the American Kennel Clubas a sporting dog, being on average between 13.5 to 15.5 inches (34 to 39 cm) high at thewithers.It is a dog of normal proportions, with medium long silky fur on the body and ears, hanging down on the legs and belly (known as feathering). The head has an upturned nose and the ears hang down.The breed standard states that size over 15.5 inches (39 cm) inches for males and 14.5 inches (37 cm) for females is a disqualification at conformation shows.American Cocker Spaniels weigh around 24 to 30 pounds (11 to 14 kg) on average, with females of the breed usually weighing slightly less than the males.<!--more--> The head of an American Cocker Spaniel makes the breed immediately recognizable, with the rounded dome of the skull, well-pronounced stop, and a square shaped lip. The drop ears are long, low set, with long silky fur, and the eyes are dark, large, and rounded. The nose can be black or brown depending on the colour of the breed. <sup id=""cite_ref-palika14_17-1""> </sup> The coat of the breed come in a variety of shades with the colours being separated into three main groups: black/black and tan, any solid colour other than black (ASCOB), and parti-colour. The black variety is either all black, or with tan points on the dog's head, the feet and the tail in a pattern called black and tan. The group known as ASCOB includes all other solid colours from light cream through to dark red, although some lighter colouring is allowed on the feathering according to standards. Parti-coloured dogs are white with patches of another colour such as black or brown, and includes any roan coloured dogs.In addition, American Cockers coats can come in a pattern known as merle, which is not recognised by the American Kennel Club. <sup id=""cite_ref-walker31_20-0""> </sup> American Cockers have rounder eyes, a domed skull, shorter muzzle and more clearly pronounced eyebrows than the English Cockers, whose head is more setter-like. In colours, the roan colours are rarer in the American variety than in the English but the shade of buff which is common in the American is not seen in the English breed at all, although there are English Cocker Spaniels which are considered to be a shade of red. The English breed is also slightly larger, being between 14.5?15.5 inches (37?39 cm) in height.<sup id=""cite_ref-sucher_21-1""> </sup> <h2>Temperament</h2> Known as the ""Merry Cocker"", the American Cocker Spaniel breed standard defines the ideal dog of the breed as being ""equable in temperament with no suggestion of timidity.""The breed ranks 20th in Stanley Coren's <i>The Intelligence of Dogs</i>, a rating that indicates good ""Working or Obedience Intelligence"", or trainability.IQ tests run on a variety of breeds in the 1950s and 1960s showed that the American Cocker performed the best when tested on its ability to show restraint and delayed response to a trigger, a trait which was put down to the breed's bred-in ability when hunting to freeze upon finding a bird before flushing it out on command. However, they proved to be the worst breed tested when it came to manipulating objects with their paws, for instance uncovering a dish of food or pulling on a string.<!--more--> With a good level of socialisation at an early age, an American Cocker can get along with people, children, other dogs and other pets. This breed seems to have a perpetually wagging tail and prefers to be around people; it is not best suited to the backyard alone. Cockers can be easily stressed by loud noises and by rough treatment or handling.<sup id=""cite_ref-coile13_27-0""> </sup> Members of the breed were originally used as hunting dogs, but increased in popularity as a show dog. It was bred more and more in conformation with the breed standard, resulting in certain attributes, such as a long coat, which no longer make it an ideal working dog.<sup id=""cite_ref-coile12_23-2""> </sup> <h2>Health</h2> American Cocker Spaniels in UK and USA/Canada surveys had a median lifespan of about 10 to 11 years, which is on the low end of the typical range for purebred dogs, and one to two years less than other breeds of their size. The larger English Cocker Spaniel typically lives about a year longer than the American Cocker Spaniel.In a 2004 UK Kennel Club survey, the most common causes of death were cancer (23%), old age (20%), cardiac (8%), and immune-mediated (8%). In a 2003 USA/Canada Health Survey with a smaller sample size, the leading causes of death were cancer, hepatic disease, and immune-mediated.<sup id=""cite_ref-American_Cocker_Club_Survey_31-0""> </sup> American Cockers previously high popularity resulted in the breed frequently being bred by backyard breeders or in puppy mills. This indiscriminate breeding has increased the proliferation of breed related health issues in certain bloodlines.<!--more--> American Cocker Spaniels are susceptible to a variety of illnesses, particularly infections affecting their ears and, in some cases, their eyes. Although the number or percent of afflicted dogs is not known, progressive retinal atrophy (PRA), glaucoma, and cataracts have been identified in some members of the breed.The American Spaniel Club recommends annual eye exams by a veterinary ophthalmologist for all dogs that are to be used for breeding. Autoimmune problems in Cockers have also been identified in an unknown number or percent of the breed, including autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA). Ear inflammations are common in drop-eared breeds of dog, including the American Cocker, and luxating patellas and hip dysplasia have been identified in some members of the breed.<sup id=""cite_ref-coile21_33-0""> </sup> Heart conditions such as dilated cardiomyopathy, where the heart becomes weakened and enlarged, and sick sinus syndrome, which is a type of abnormal heart beating which causes low blood pressure, have been identified in the breed. Phosphofructokinase deficiency is a condition caused by a recessive gene in the breed which prevents the metabolism of glucose into energy, causing the dog to be extremely low energy and unable to exercise. The gene which causes this appears in around 10 percent of the population, but DNA testing can prevent two carrier dogs from breeding and thus creating puppies with this condition.<sup id=""cite_ref-coile22_34-0""> </sup> American Cockers are also prone to canine epilepsy and the related condition known as Rage Syndrome.The latter is a form of epilepsy which can cause a normally placid dog to engage in sudden and unprovoked violent attacks. <sup id=""cite_ref-coile23_35-1""></sup> Initial research shows that both conditions appear to be inheritable.<sup id=""cite_ref-markderr_37-0""><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Cocker_Spaniel#cite_note-markderr-37""> </a></sup>",NULL,NULL,NULL,"Y","0"

George Washington received French Foxhounds,Grand Bleu de Gascogne, (which look much like an American Bluetick Coonhound) as a gift from the Marquis de Lafayette. Many of the dogs Washington kept were descended from Brooke's, and when crossed with the French hounds, helped to create the present day American Foxhound. The American Foxhound is known to originate from the states of Maryland and Virginia, and is the state dog of Virginia."" Code of Virginia"". <i>1?510</i>. Retrieved 28 March 2011.Though there has long been a rumor that the new breed was originally used for hunting Indigenous peoples of the Americas, this is not true. <!--more-->The breed was developed by landed gentry purely for the sport of hunting foxes. With the importation (or migration) of the red fox, Irish Foxhounds were added to the lines, to increase speed and stamina in the dog, qualities still prevalent in today's dogs. One quality that the American Foxhound is famous for is its musical howl that can be heard for miles. This is actually one reason that this breed does not do well in city settings. The breed was first recognized by theAmerican Kennel Club in 1886. Today, there are many different strains of American Foxhound, including Walker, Calhoun, Goodman,Trigg, July and Penn-Marydel. Though each strain looks quite different, they are all recognized as members of the same breed. Most show hounds are Walkers, many of the pack hounds (used with hunting foxes on horseback) are Penn-Marydel and hunters use a variety of strains to suit their hunting style and quarry. <h3>Appearance</h3> While standards call for the American Foxhound to be about 21?25 inches (530?640 mm) tall to the withers, and weigh anywhere between 65?75 pounds (29?34 kg), many of them are larger in structure (especially the show strains), with males standing 26?29 inches (660?740 mm) and females 25?28 inches (640?710 mm) and smaller in weight, typically between 45?65 pounds (20?29 kg). For years it was traditional to feed Foxhounds on a diet of ""dog bread"", a variation on cornbread. The legs of a Foxhound are very long and straight-boned. The foxhound's chest is rather narrow. It has a long muzzle, and a large, domed skull. The ears are wide and low-set. The eyes are hazel or brown, and are large and wide-set. <h3>Defining Physical Characteristics</h3> The American Foxhound is taller and rangier when compared to its cousin, the English Foxhound. Also, this breed is known to have a musical bark when it is hunting that can be heard for miles. If competing in a dog show, some physical characteristics that judges would look for would be a slightly domed skull, long, large ears, large eyes, straight muzzle, well laid-back shoulders, a moderately long back, fox-like feet, and a slightly curved tail. Though they are traditionally tri-colored (black, white and tan) they can be any color.They are the rarest breed in the American Kennel Club. <h3>Temperament</h3> The American Foxhound is gentle, easygoing, and gets along with children and other animals.""AKC Meet the Breeds",NULL,NULL,NULL,"Y","0"

As of January 1, 2004, theUnited Kennel Club deemed the AHT a separate terrier breed. An intelligent, social and energetic working breed, the American Hairless Terrier is often listed as a potential good breed choice for allergy sufferers. <h2>History</h2> The American Hairless Terrier's American ancestry begins with the mixed breed terriers called Feists brought from Europe to the North America as early as the 18th century. In the late 1800s the Rat Terrier breed was developed from the Feist by the addition of Beagle,Italian Greyhound and Miniature Pinscher bloodlines. The distinct American Hairless Terrier breed began in 1972 when one hairless puppy named Josephine appeared in a Rat Terrier litter in the state of Louisiana, United States. Owners Edwin and Willie Scott liked the dog's look and temperament, and upon maturity bred her hoping to reproduce the hairless quality. They were eventually successful; a litter produced in 1981 provided the foundation stock of the breed.<!--more--> <h3>Breed recognition</h3> In 1998 the breed gained recognition as the American Hairless Terrier by the American Rare Breeds Association and the National Rat Terrier Club. Canada was the first country outside the US to gain recognition, by Canadian Rarities in 1999. In 1999 the breed was recognized as Rat Terrier, Hairless Variety by the United Kennel Club. In the U.S., the American Hairless Terrier Association is the provisional breed club. Other National Breed Clubs around the world include the Canadian American Hairless Terrier Association and the Japanese Hairless American Terrier Club. On January 1, 2004, the United Kennel Club (UKC) recognized the American Hairless Terrier as a distinct breed.<sup id=""cite_ref-1"">[1]</sup> The American Kennel Club (AKC) also includes the American Hairless Terrier within its Foundation Stock Series and allows them to participate in AKC Performance events and in Open shows. Despite its smaller size the AHT is not a toy breed. Rather, like its Rat Terrier cousin, the AHT is a working breed. <h2>Coated American Hairless Terrier</h2> In its 2006 description, the UKC continued to recognize the hairless and coated varieties of the American Hairless Terrier noting that ""[w]hile it may seem contradictory to have coated dogs in a hairless breed, it will be necessary for the foreseeable future to continue to include some Rat Terrier crosses until there are sufficient hairless dogs to maintain a separate and healthy gene pool"".<sup id=""cite_ref-2""> </sup> <div> <div><img alt="""" src=""http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/69/AHT_frisbee.jpg/220px-AHT_frisbee.jpg"" srcset=""//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/69/AHT_frisbee.jpg/330px-AHT_frisbee.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/69/AHT_frisbee.jpg/440px-AHT_frisbee.jpg 2x"" width=""220"" height=""192"" /> <div> <div><img alt="""" src=""http://bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.23wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png"" width=""15"" height=""11"" /></div> American Hairless Terrier blue tri coated male with frisbee</div> </div> </div> <h2>Description</h2> <div> <div>American Hairless Terriers are very energetic.</div> </div> The American Hairless Terrier is a smoothly muscled, active, small-to-medium terrier. <b>Height</b>: 7-18 inches (18?45.7 cm.) <b>Life Span:</b> 14?16 years. <b>Weight</b>: 7-25 pounds (2.5?12 kg.) <b>Skin Color</b>: White (to varying degrees) with a variety of colors including black, blue, pink, brown, tan, and sable.

The AHT is therefore very similar to the Rat Terrier and the coated AHT is almost indistinguishable from its Rat Terrier cousin. However, since the first litter born in 1982 from the originating hairless female, the AHT has continued to be developed as a distinct breed (see ""Breed Recognition"") with several characteristics that distinguish the AHT from its Rat Terrier origins. These differences include smaller sizes, more refined features, new eye colors, new patterns, new (skin) colors and, of course, a complete lack of fur on the hairless variety. Other breeder choices have further differentiated the AHT. AHT breeders and clubs promote the undocked tail appearance on hairless, unlike the more traditionally docked appearance of the Rat Terrier. To date, the hairless trait has not been bred over to the other types of Rat Terrier such as the Giant Decker Rat Terrier or the Type B Rat Terrier (also known as the Teddy Roosevelt Terrier). <h2>Hairless breeds and genetics</h2> While there are unproven theories that other hairless dog breeds have common ancestry, the recent evolution of the American Hairless Terrier demonstrates an independent evolution from other hairless breeds. A key difference found between the American Hairless Terrier and other Hairless Dog breeds is that the AHT's hairless gene is recessive, while the gene for hairlessness found in the ancient breeds is a lethal dominant. The American Hairless Terrier does not have dental issues (absent premolars) or other characteristics associated with the dominant hairless gene. For dogs where hairlessness is a dominant gene, hairless to hairless matings will on average produce 66.6% hairless and 33.3% coated puppies. For hairless to coated matings, there will be an average of 50%/50% coated to hairless ratio, while for coated to coated matings, all puppies will be coated. Matings between hairless AHTs will produce completely hairless litters while hairless AHT to coated AHT or Rat Terrier are more variable and will produce mixed hairless litters to all coated litters. <h2>Hypoallergenic dog breed</h2> There is no scientific evidence supporting the existence of a completely hypoallergenic dog breed and hairlessness is not the sole characteristic that will determine allergic reactions or its degree. The American Hairless Terrier Association recommends individual allergy tests prior to adopting an AHT. <h2>Temperament</h2> The American Hairless Terrier (AHT) is an intelligent, curious, and energetic breed that is compatible with small children. Graceful and elegant, the American Hairless Terrier is also strong and athletic. The AHT enjoys participating in agility games like its other terrier cousins. The AHT typically likes to dig, chase small game and will bark when alarmed and will act as a good watch dog. Its ancestry gives the AHT a strong hunting instinct but its lack of coat makes it a less likely candidate for a hunting dog as rough underbrush may hurt the AHT's unprotected skin. The AHT is not a strong swimmer and should be monitored around water. <h2>Health</h2> The American Hairless Terrier continues to be a rare breed with a limited breeding stock. The UKC recognizes the need to continue to breed in Rat Terrier blood lines (see ""Coated American Hairless Terrier"") until ""breed of breeds"" (also, see ""Genetics"" above). Although often stated otherwise, AHTs do not have sweat glands. There is no scientific evidence to suggest an independent evolution of sweat glands unique to this breed. The misperception has likely arisen from the presence of sebaceous glands associated with hair follicles. These are the same glands that are present in all canines. The hairless variety of this breed has the same follicles, however the ""hair"" is lost early on as the dog matures.<!--more--> Rashes due to grass allergies are not entirely uncommon. Other allergies may occur as well, but this is no different than most other breeds of dogs. Due to their lack of hair, they may need protection from the sun (based on the season, their geographic location and the individual dog's degree of pigmentation or lack thereof). If needed, sunscreen can be applied or a light shirt may be worn. Clothing is oftentimes used, not only for the protection from the sun but from the cold as well (where the climate warrants).",NULL,NULL,NULL,"Y","0"

It is a member of the molosser breed group. The American Staffordshire Terrier and The American Pit Bull Terrier (APBT) by breed are from the same lineage; Staffordshires was the name given by AKC, and American Pit Bull Terriers by UKC. The real difference between the two breeds is 6?8"" in height and 25?35 lb in weight; the American Staffordshire being the larger of the two. The dog was bred first to bait bulls and bears. When bear-baiting and bull-baiting were deemed inhumane, rat-baiting and dog fighting became more popular. The APBT Breed was used in both sports, and its prevalence in being put in pits with rats, or other dogs led to ""pit"" being added to its name.<!--more--> The American Pit Bull is medium-sized, and has a short coat and smooth well-defined muscle structure. Its eyes are round to almond shaped, and its ears are small to medium in length and can be natural or cropped. The tail is slightly thick and tapers to a point. The coat is glossy, smooth, short, and stiff to the touch. The accepted coat color can vary widely, but, both the AKC and UKC do not recognize merle coloring. Twelve countries in Europe, as well as Australia, Canada, Ecuador, Malaysia, New Zealand, Puerto Rico, Singapore, and Venezuela have enacted some form of breed-specific legislation on pit bull-type dogs, including American Pit Bull Terriers, ranging from outright bans to restrictions and conditions on ownership. The state of New South Wales in Australia places restrictions on the breed, including mandatory sterilization. A few counties, and cities in the United States as well as the Province of Ontario in Canada, have outright banned ownership of the American Pit Bull terrier, and the breed is banned in the UK. <h2>History</h2> <div> <div>World War I poster featuring a pit bull as representation of the U.S.</div> </div> During the 19th century, England, Ireland, and Scotland began to experiment with crosses between bulldogs and terriers, looking for a dog that combined the gameness, speed, and agility of the terrier with the strength and athleticism of the bulldog.<sup id=""cite_ref-arba_2-0"">[2]</sup> In the late 19th century to early 20th century, two clubs were formed for the specific purpose of registering APBTs: the United Kennel Club and the American Dog Breeders Association. The United Kennel Club was founded in 1898, and was the first registry to recognize the breed, with the owner assigning the first number to his own APBT.<sup id=""cite_ref-ukc_3-0""> </sup> The dog was bred first to bait bulls and bears.<sup id=""cite_ref-badrap_4-0"">[4]</sup> When baiting bulls was deemed inhumane, ratting (a sport where a number of rats were placed in a pit for a specified time with the dog) and dog fighting became more popular. The APBT was used in both sports, and its prevalence in being put in pits with rats or other dogs led to ""pit"" being added to its name.<sup id=""cite_ref-5""> </sup> In America, farmers and ranchers used their APBTs for protection, as catch dogs for semi-wild cattle and hogs, to hunt, and to drive livestock.<span style=""font-size: 11px;""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""> </span></span> The dog was used during World War I and World War II as a way of delivering messages on the battlefield. Though of the same family, the American Pit Bull Terrier diverges in appearance from the many sporting dogs from Europe used in creating the American Pit Bull Terrier. APBT is medium sized, having a short coat and smooth well-defined muscle structure, but should never appear bulky or muscle-bound. Its eyes are round to almond shaped, and its ears are small to medium in length and can be natural or cropped. The tail is slightly thin (reference: rat tail) and tapers to a point. The coat is glossy, smooth, short, and slightly stiff and can be any color.The breed ranges from a height of about 14 to 24 in (36 to 61 cm) at shoulders, females weigh between 30 and 50 lb (14 and 23 kg) and males weigh between 30 and 60 lb (14 and 27 kg).<sup id=""cite_ref-ukc_3-1""> </sup> [button link=""http://alphamatch.com/listing-type/pets/?pet-type=1081&amp;breed-2=1035"" color=""black"" type=""big-button"" type=""Search for American Pit Bull Terrier""]Search for American Pit Bull Terrier[/button] <h3>Temperament</h3> <blockquote>The essential characteristics of the American Pit Bull Terrier are strength, confidence, and zest for life. This breed is eager to please and brimming over with enthusiasm. APBTs make excellent family companions and have always been noted for their love of children. Because most APBTs exhibit some level of dog aggression and because of its powerful physique, the APBT requires an owner who will carefully socialize and obedience train the dog. The breed?s natural agility makes it one of the most capable canine climbers so good fencing is a must for this breed. The APBT is not the best choice for a guard dog since they are extremely friendly, even with strangers. Aggressive behavior toward humans is uncharacteristic of the breed and highly undesirable. This breed does very well in performance events because of its high level of intelligence and its willingness to work.<sup id=""cite_ref-7""> </sup></blockquote> In September, 2000 a meta-analysis conducted by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was published which examined dog bite related fatalities (human death caused by dog bite injuries) over a 20 year period from 1979-1998. The study examined 238 fatalities in which the breed of dog was known. The study was surmised to covered approximately 72% of known dog bite related fatalities during that period. Over a 20 year period, ""pit bull-type dogs"" were involved with more dog bite related fatalities than any other breed.However in the later half of the study Rottweilers accounted for more dog bite related fatalities than pit bulls. It must also be noted, from the American Temperament Test Society Inc. http://atts.org/ When 500 dogs or more have been tested, the American Pit Bull Terrier ranked second as the safest breed in the test. Thus giving away the call reference for the breed ""Nanny Dog"". <h3>Health</h3> <div> <div>The breed tends not to have a higher than average incidence of hip dysplasia. Culling for performance has help eliminate this problem and others such as patella problems, thyroid dysfunction and congenital heart defects.<span style=""font-size: 11px;""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""> </span></span> American Pit Bull Terriers with dilute coat colors have not had a higher occurrence of skin allergies as other breeds.<span style=""font-size: 11px;""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""> </span></span> As a breed they are more susceptible to parvovirus than others if not vaccinated, especially as puppies, so vaccination is imperative beginning at 39 days old and continuing every 2 weeks until 4 months old. Then again at 8 months. Once a year after that, as recommend for all breeds.</div> </div> They are not very prone to Demodex Mange due to culling for performance. There are two different types of Demodex Mange, namely Localized and Generalized Demodex. Although it is not contagious it is sometimes difficult to treat due to immunodeficiency in some puppies. The Localized symptoms are usually loss of hair in small patches on the head and feet of the puppies. This type will usually heal as the puppies grow and their immune systems grow stronger. The second type which is Generalized Demodex mange is a more severe form of the sickness. The symptoms are more severe and include loss of hair throughout the entire body and the skin may also be scabby and bloody. Generalized are usually hereditary due to immunodeficiency genes that are passed on from Sire and Dam to their puppies. This syndrome will only manifest its self from low quality feed and from being kept in a poor environment which will suppress the immune system. A simple skin scraping test will allow the vet to diagnose demodex mange. The most widely used method to treat Demodex Mange is ivermectin injections or oral medications. Since Demodex Mange lives in the hair follicles of the dog, Ivermectin will kill these mites at the source.<sup id=""cite_ref-13""> </sup> <h2>Varieties</h2> <h3>Old Family Red Nose</h3> Old Family Red Nose (OFRN) is an old strain of American Pit Bull Terriers known for their specific reddish colorization. A dog of the red-nosed strain has a copper-red nose and coat, red lips, red toe nails, and red or amber eyes.<sup id=""cite_ref-14""> </sup> <h4>History</h4> In the middle of the 19th century, there was a breed of pit dogs in Ireland that were known as ""Old Family."" At that time, all the strains were closely inbred with each family Klan. Since red is recessive to all colors but white, the breed was known as ""Irish Old Family Reds."" When the dogs began coming to America, they were already showing the red nose. The ""Old Family Reds"" dogs found their way to America mainly via Irish immigrants though many here in the United Sates did import the breed. Many strains have been crossed with the Old Family Reds at some time in their existence. This is how the breed of American Pit Bull Terrier was created. Consequently, nearly any strain will occasionally throw a red-nosed pup. To many dog owners, these red-nosed individuals are Old Family Red Noses even though the great preponderance of their blood is that of other strains. Sometimes such individuals will fail to measure up and thereby reflect undeserved discredit on the red-nosed strain. However the Old Family Reds produced more then their share of good ones unlike other strains are known. Old Family Reds were sought after for their high percentage in ability to produced deep gameness. Originally renowned for its gameness, it continues to be bred to maintain its unique reddish color. Some of the most reputable breeders in all Pit Bull history such as Lightner, McClintock, Hemphill, Williams, Menefee, Norrod and Wallace have contributed to the preservation and development of the strain. Finally, as McNolty said in his 30-30 Journal (1967) ""Regardless of one's historical perspective, these old amber-eyed, red-nosed, red-toe-nailed, red-coated dogs represent some of the most significant pit bull history and tradition that stands on four legs today.""

An early reference to the breed's predecessors was made in an 1853 book, ""Tierleben der Alpenwelt"" (Animal Life in the Alps), referring to dogs in the Appenzell region. The Appenzeller Sennenhund was only recognised internationally as a separate breed in 1989.<sup id=""cite_ref-2""> </sup> The Appenzeller Sennenhund was originally kept primarily as a a cattle herding dog, and a flock guardian. It was also used as a draft dog, and general farm dog. The breed also was known for it's affinity to both herd and guard with such devotion that they would give their life to protect their charge. Today the breed is primarily kept as a companion, and excels in agility/flyball competitions, obedience competitions and Schutzhund. They are also still used in many places as working cattle dogs even now. They are highly intelligent, and learn quickly. <h2>Temperament</h2> As with all medium to large, very active working dogs, the Appenzeller Sennenhund should be well socialized early in life with other dogs and people and provided with regular activity and training if they are to be safely kept as a pet. If trained properly, they bond closely with their owners and like to seek for attention. As a result of careful regulated breeding, the Appenzeller breed, as a whole, though individual genetic lines vary, is an extremely healthy breed. Especially for a dog of it's size and weight. The breed, in general, is known to have a lifespan, on average, of 13-17 years.

It is one of few natural breeds not subjected to hard selection by phenotype. They preserved the genetic variation that other dog breeds had initially. This genetic variation was promoted by spontaneous and, in some cases, intentional periodic matings with locally indigenous wolves (still present).

A scent hound 22-23 inches high at the withers, weighing anything between 55 and 65 pounds, it is a well constructed dog with a slow graceful gait. It has a large, strong head, a medium-length back and a pointed tail that tends to be long and sickle-shaped. Their ears are set at eye level; they have large prominent eyes and quite thick lips. <h2>Characteristics</h2> <h3>Appearance</h3> A well constructed dog, muscled and not too long, giving the impression of strength and energy. <h4>Head</h4> <ul> <li>Cranial Region: Its skull should be strong, broad, quite short, rounded and flat at its upper part but with the occipital protuberance only slightly pronounced. Its stop should be accentuated.</li> <li>Facial Region: Its nose should be black, strong, with wide opened nostrils. Its muzzle should be straight and, seen in profile, moderately elongated. Of its lips, the upper lip should largely be covering the lower lip and must be rather important so as to give a square shape to the extremity of the muzzle, (as seen in profile). Its jaws/teeth should have a scissor bite, the upper incisors covering the lower in a narrow contact and are well set squarely in relation to the jaws. Its eyes, in relation to the width of the forehead, should not be very close together; they should be round, level with the head surface, with a melancholic and soft expression; they are dark brown in colour. The mucous membranes of the lower lids must not be visible. Its leathers should be set at eye level, a little thick, broad, round at the tip, almost flat and quite long, reaching the beginning of the nose. Its is moderately long, powerful; very little dewlap.</li> </ul> <h4>Body</h4> Its back is broad and well supported. Its loins are slightly arched. The hips give a slight inclination to its croup, which is well muscled. Its chest is broad and long, rather let down so that the sternal line arrives at elbow level. Its ribs should be well sprung. Its belly flanks fully its body. <h4>Tail</h4> It is strong and quite long; there should be some longer and coarser, slightly offstanding hairs, (like ears of grain) towards the tip. It is carried in a sickle fashion, never falling forward. <h4>Limbs</h4> <h5>Forequarters</h5> A view of the ensemble indicates that its limbs are strong and vertical. Its shoulders are oblique and muscled. Its elbows are set well in the axis of the body. Its forearm should be lightly oblique. <h5>Hindquarters</h5> A view of the ensemble indicates that, (seen from behind), the point of the buttock, the middle of the leg, the hock, the metatarsal and the foot are on the same vertical line. Its upper thighs are let down and well muscled. Its hock joints are strong and moderately angulated, and the metatarsals are short and strong. <h5>Feet</h5> They are slightly elongated, strong but sufficiently tight; the pads are black, tough and compact. <h4>Coat and colour</h4> Its skin is quite thick. Its hair is short, thick and quite flat. The coat pattern is a dark fawn tri-colour, (similar to the coat of a hare or a badger), with a mantle or in large patches. The head is usually fawn, sometimes with a black overlay. Its main colours being tan and black and white in any combination. <h3>Temperament</h3> The Artois Hound is an energetic dog that is brave and loyal. Though it has a large amount of endurance, it is calm and well balanced. It is a moderate sized dog that will feature the best characteristics of the scenthounds. It has a powerful sense of smell, and it is fast and independent. These dogs were bred to hunt rabbits, and they are proficient at this task. These dogs need to be trained by owners who are consistent. They are affectionate and loving to those that care for them. Like all scent hounds they are happiest when on the trail of a good scent. <h4>Hunting</h4> The Artois Hound, (a Briquet, (of a small type)), is nowadays used especially in hunting with guns, and on horseback. It drives the game closer taking advantage of their faults with ingenuity; its speed is average but maintained. <ul> <li>In general countryside : Because of its acute sense of smell, it is capable of outmanoeuvring many of its prey's tactics.</li> <li>In woodland areas : With its ancestral qualities of a hunter, in sparse and well scattered groups of tall trees, it can hunt a deer efficiently, and in the desired direction of its owner.</li> <li>In the thicket : its intrepidity and bravery means that it can stir up and even the most obstinate boars.</li> <li>Additional points: It is a robust animal with a high pitched call which can be heard from as far away as 2 km.<sup> </sup></li> </ul> <h2>Health Problems</h2> There are no known health problems that are specific to the Artois Hound. Any health problems it may develop can be found in most other dog breeds. These dogs may have a maximum life expectancy of 13 years.<sup> </sup> <h2>Care</h2> <h3>Exercise</h3> This is a hunting dog that needs extensive amounts of exercise. Without it, the dog could become problematic for its owners. It should be taken on walks daily, and this dog is great for healthy people who love to jog and hike. While it can live in an apartment, it may perform better in a small yard. It is important for owners to make sure this dog is never unleashed in an unsecured area, as it may run off in the direction of the first interesting scent it picks up. It is important for owners to make sure these dogs are given lots of space to move around in. <h3>Grooming</h3> The Artois Hound does not require a large amount of grooming. The Artois' smooth short-haired coat is easy to look after. Owners will simply want to make sure the coat is brushed on a consistent basis. These dogs should only be given baths when they need it. A wipe down with a damp towel should suffice for the bathing aspect, (although you should bathe it with mild soap only if or when necessary; you should also dry shampoo it occasionally), however a rubber, wire, or hard bristled brush would work best for the brushing aspect.The shedding patterns of these dogs are not known. Be sure to check the ears carefully for signs of infection. The nails of the D'Artois should also be trimmed, (particularly to avoid nail-born infections). <h2>History</h2> This breed, formerly named Picard, was much appreciated in ancient hunting at the time of Henry IV of France and Louis XIII of France, and much sought after. Selincourt already made much of it, wondering and amazed to see these dogs pulling a hare which had passed by one hour ago in dry weather.

In the 19th century, New South Wales cattle farmer Thomas Hall crossed the dogs used by drovers in his parents' home county, Northumberland, with dingoes he had tamed. The resulting dogs were known as Halls Heelers. After Hall's death in 1870, the dogs became available beyond the Hall family and their associates, and were subsequently developed into two modern breeds, the Australian Cattle Dog and the Australian Stumpy Tail Cattle Dog. Robert Kaleski was influential in the Cattle Dog's early development, and wrote the first standard for the breed. The Australian Cattle Dog is a medium-sized, short-coated dog that occurs in two main colour forms. It has either brown or black hair distributed fairly evenly through a white coat, which gives the appearance of a ""red"" or ""blue"" dog. It has been nicknamed a ""Red Heeler"" or ""Blue Heeler"" on the basis of this colouring and its practice of moving reluctant cattle by nipping at their heels. Dogs from a line bred in Queensland, Australia, which were successful at shows and at stud in the 1940s, were called ""Queensland Heelers"" to differentiate them from lines bred in New South Wales; this nickname is now occasionally applied to any Australian Cattle Dog. As with dogs from other working breeds, the Australian Cattle Dog has a high level of energy, a quick intelligence, and an independent streak. It responds well to structured training, particularly if it is interesting and challenging. It was originally bred to herd by biting, and is known to nip running children. It forms a strong attachment to its owners, and can be protective of them and their possessions. It is easy to groom and maintain, requiring little more than brushing during the shedding period. The most common health problems are deafness and progressive blindness (both hereditary conditions) and accidental injury; otherwise, it is a robust breed with a lifespan of 12 to 14 years. Australian Cattle Dogs now participate in a range of activities beyond the herding they were bred for, including competing with their owners in sporting events and working as assistance dogs.

It has a broad skull that flattens to a definite stop between the eyes, with muscular cheeks and a medium-length, deep, powerful muzzle. The ears are pricked, small to medium in size and set wide apart, with a covering of hair on the inside. The eyes are oval and dark, with an alert, keen expression. The neck and shoulders are strong and muscular; the forelegs are straight and parallel; and the feet round and arched, with small, sturdy toes and nails.<sup id=""cite_ref-ANKC_1-0""> </sup> The Cattle Dog breed standard states that it should have well-conditioned muscles, even when bred for companion or show purposes, and that its appearance should be symmetrical and balanced, with no individual part of the dog exaggerated. It should not look either delicate or cumbersome, as either characteristic limits the agility and endurance that is necessary for a working dog.<sup id=""cite_ref-ANKC_1-1""> </sup> <h4>Size</h4> The female Australian Cattle Dog measures approximately 43?48 centimetres (17?19 in) at the withers, and the male measures about 46?51 centimetres (18?20 in) at the withers. The dog should be longer than tall, that is, the length of the body from breast bone to buttocks is greater than the height at the withers, in a ratio of 10 to 9.<sup id=""cite_ref-ANKC_1-2"">[1]</sup> An Australian Cattle Dog in good condition weighs around 15?22 kilograms (33?49 lb). <h4>Coat and colour</h4> There are two accepted coat colours, red and blue, though chocolate and cream do occur. Blue dogs can be blue, blue mottled, or blue speckled with or without black, tan, or white markings. Red dogs are evenly speckled with solid red markings. Both red dogs and blue dogs are born white (except for any solid-coloured body or face markings) and the red or black hairs grow in as they mature. The distinctive adult colouration is the result of black or red hairs closely interspersed through a predominantly white coat. This is not merlecolouration (a speckled effect that has associated health issues), but rather the result of the ticking gene. A number of breeds show ticking, which is the presence of colour through white areas, though the overall effect depends on other genes that will modify the size, shape and density of the ticking.<sup id=""cite_ref-2""> </sup> In addition to the primary colouration, an Australian Cattle Dog displays some patches of solid or near-solid colour. In both red and blue dogs, the most common are masks over one or both eyes, a white tip to the tail, a solid spot at the base of the tail, and sometimes solid spots on the body, though these are not desirable in dogs bred for conformation shows. Blue dogs can have tan midway up the legs and extending up the front to breast and throat, with tan on jaws, and tan eyebrows. Both colour forms can have a white ""star"" on the forehead called the ""Bentley Mark"", after a legendary dog owned by Tom Bentley. Common miscolours in the Australian Cattle Dog are black hairs in a red-coated dog, including the extreme of a black saddle on a red dog, and extensive tan on the face and body on a blue dog, called creeping tan. The Cattle Dog has a double coat?the short, straight outer guard hairs are protective in nature, keeping the elements from the dog's skin while the undercoat is short, fine and dense.<sup id=""cite_ref-Buetow_3-1""> </sup> The mask consists of a black patch over one or both eyes (for the blue coat colour) or a red patch over one or both eyes (for the red coat colour). Depending on whether one or both eyes have a patch, these are called, respectively, ""single"" (or ""half"") mask and ""double"" (or ""full"") mask. Dogs without a mask are called plain-faced. Any of these are acceptable according to the breed standard. In conformation shows, even markings are preferred over uneven markings.<sup id=""cite_ref-ANKC_1-4""> </sup> <h4>Tail</h4> The breed standards of the Australian, American and Canadian kennel clubs specify that the Australian Cattle Dog should have a natural, long, un-docked tail. There will often be a solid colour spot at the base of the tail and a white tip. The tail should be set moderately low, following the slope of the back. It should hang in a slight curve at rest, though an excited dog may carry its tail higher. The tail should feature a reasonable level of brush.<sup id=""cite_ref-ANKC_1-5""> </sup> In the US, tails are sometimes docked on working stock. The tail is not docked in Australia, and serves a useful purpose in increasing agility and the ability to turn quickly. The Australian Cattle Dog is a breed distinct from the Australian Stumpy Tail Cattle Dog, a square-bodied dog born with a naturally ""bobbed"" tail. The Stumpy Tail resembles the Australian Cattle Dog, but has a taller, leaner conformation. It occasionally has a natural long thin tail, but most are born without tails.<sup id=""cite_ref-Stumpy_6-0""> </sup> [button link=""http://alphamatch.com/listing-type/pets/?pet-type=1081&amp;breed-2=283"" color=""black"" type=""big-button"" type=""Search for Australian Cattle Dog""]Search for Australian Cattle Dog[/button] &nbsp; <h3>Temperament</h3> Like many working dogs, the Australian Cattle Dog has high energy levels, an active mind, and a level of independence. The breed ranks 10th in Stanley Coren's <i>The Intelligence of Dogs</i>, rated as one of the most intelligent dogs ranked by obedience command trainability. The Cattle Dog needs plenty of exercise, companionship and a job to do, so a non-working dog might participate in dog sports, learning tricks, or other activities that engage its body and mind.<sup id=""cite_ref-Robertson_7-1""> </sup> When on home ground, the Australian Cattle Dog is a happy, affectionate, and playful pet. However, it is reserved with people it does not know and naturally cautious in new situations. Its attitude to strangers makes it an excellent guard dog when trained for this task, and it can be socialised to become accustomed to a variety of people from an early age as a family pet. It is good with older, considerate children, but will herd people by nipping at their heels, particularly younger children who run and squeal. By the time puppies are weaned, they should have learned that the company of people is pleasurable, and that responding to cues from a person is rewarding. The bond that this breed can create with its owner is strong and will leave the dog feeling protective towards the owner, typically resulting in the dog's never being too far from the owner's side. The Australian Cattle Dog can be the friendliest of companions although it is quick to respond to the emotions of its owners, and may defend them without waiting for a command. The ACD was originally bred to move reluctant cattle by biting, and it will bite if treated harshly. The Australian Cattle Dog's protective nature and tendency to nip at heels can be dangerous as the dog grows into an adult if unwanted behaviours are left unchecked.<sup id=""cite_ref-beauchamp_12-0""> </sup> While an Australian Cattle Dog generally works silently, it will bark in alarm or to attract attention. It has a distinctive intense, high-pitched bark. Barking can be a sign of boredom or frustration, although research has shown that pet dogs increase their vocalisation when raised in a noisy environment. It responds well to familiar dogs, but when multiple dogs are present, establishing a pecking order can trigger aggression. It is not a breed that lives in a pack with other dogs.<sup id=""cite_ref-Lowell_9-2""> </sup> Data accumulated from Council reports in New South Wales from 2004-2005 showed that dogs identified as Australian Cattle Dogs were involved in more attacks than any other breed except the German Shepherd, where an attack is defined as any incident where a dog rushes at, bites, harasses or chases any person or animal. Fourteen other breeds were involved in incidents. Expressed as a percentage of registered dogs, 0.1% of Australian Cattle Dogs were involved in attacks. The data gathered in 2011-2012 listed the Australian Cattle dog twenty-seventh in involvement in incidents ranked by percentage of dogs registered.<span style=""font-size: 11px;""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""> </span></span> A review of incidents in Melbourne where a dog bit, rushed at or chased a person or animal in a public space, found that there were sixty breeds involved and the German Shepherd and German Shepherd crosses, and Australian Cattle Dog and Cattle Dog crosses accounted for 9% of incidents. Surveys of U.S. breed club members showed that both dog-directed aggression and stranger-directed aggression were higher in the ACD than the average of breeds studied, with dog-directed aggression being the more prevalent of the two aggression types. The American Temperament Test Society reports a test pass rate of 79.3% for Australian Cattle Dogs. The average pass rate for all breeds combined is 80.4%.<sup id=""cite_ref-20""> </sup> <h2>As pets</h2> <h3>Grooming</h3> Known as a ""wash and wear"" dog, the Australian Cattle Dog requires little grooming, and an occasional brushing is all that is required to keep the coat clean and odour-free. Even for the showring it needs no more than wiping down with a moist cloth. It is not a year-round shedder but blows its coat once a year (twice in the case of intact females) and frequent brushing and a warm bath during this period will contain the shedding hair. As with all dogs, regular attention to nails, ears and teeth will help avoid health problems.<sup id=""cite_ref-Beauchamp_21-0""> </sup> <h3>Training</h3> In Katherine Buetow's guide to the Australian Cattle Dog, Ian Dunbar makes the point that while people think of dog training as teaching a dog to sit, speak and roll-over, the dog already knows how to do these things. Training, he says, involves teaching the dog that it is a good idea to do these things when a particular word is said or signal is given. He goes on to explain his belief that training is about opening communication channels, so that the dog knows what the handler wants it to do, and knows that it will be worth its while to do it. Consequences for the dog can be rewards for doing what is required, as recommended by Dunbar, or corrections where an unwanted behaviour is performed. Like other working breeds, the Australian Cattle Dog is intelligent and responsive; both of these traits can be an advantage in training where a structured, varied program is used, but can lead to unwanted outcomes if training is not consistent, or is repetitive and boring for the dog. Stock dog trainer Scott Lithgow recommends making training a game so the Cattle Dog learns that obedience leads to enjoyment. Many of a Cattle Dog's natural behaviours are undesirable in a pet: barking, chewing, chasing, digging, defending territory, and nipping heels. Training, therefore, involves helping the dog adopt a lifestyle that is probably very different from that of its droving ancestors. The Australian Cattle Dog is biddable, and responds well to training.<sup id=""cite_ref-Stockman_23-0""> </sup> [button link=""http://alphamatch.com/listing-type/pets/?pet-type=1081&amp;breed-2=283"" color=""black"" type=""big-button"" type=""Search for Australian Cattle Dog""]Search for Australian Cattle Dog[/button] &nbsp; <h3>Activities</h3> <div> <div>The breed is well suited for agility trials.</div> </div> The Australian Cattle Dog demands a high level of physical activity. Like many other herding dog breeds, the Cattle Dog has an active and fertile mind and if it is not given jobs to do it will find its own activities ? which might not please the owner. It will appreciate a walk around the neighbourhood, but it needs structured activities that engage and challenge it, and regular interaction with its owner. While individual dogs have their own personalities and abilities, as a breed the Australian Cattle Dog is suited to any activity that calls for athleticism, intelligence, and endurance.<sup id=""cite_ref-Robertson_7-3""> </sup> Kennel club-sponsored herding trials with a range of events suit the driving abilities of the Cattle Dog and other upright breeds, whilesheepdog trials are more suited to the ""eye"" breeds such as the Border Collie and Australian Kelpie. Herding instincts and trainability are measured at non-competitive herding tests, and basic commands are sometimes taught through herding games, where rules such as ""stay"", ""get it"" and ""that'll do"" are applied to fetching a ball or chasing a yard broom.<sup id=""cite_ref-24""> </sup> The Australian Cattle Dog was developed for its ability to encourage reluctant cattle to travel long distances, and may be the best breed in the world for this work. However, some working dog trainers have expressed concern that dogs bred for the show ring are increasingly too short in the legs and too stocky in the body to undertake the work for which they were originally bred.<sup id=""cite_ref-Lithgow_10-3""> </sup> <div> <div> <div>Australian Cattle Dogs were bred to drive cattle, but are also used to herd sheep.</div> </div> </div> Among the most popular activities for an Australian Cattle Dog is dog agility. It is ideally suited for navigating obstacle courses, since as a herding dog it is reactive to the handler's body language and willing to work accurately at a distance from the handler. Agility has been used by Cattle Dog owners to instil confidence in their dogs, and enhance their performance in training and competition.<sup id=""cite_ref-25""> </sup> The Australian Cattle Dog thrives on change and new experiences, and many handlers find training the breed challenging for this reason. An Australian Cattle Dog can excel in obedience competition. It will enjoy the challenges, such as retrieving a scented article, but the breed's problem-solving ability may lead it to find solutions to problems that are not necessarily rewarded by the obedience judges. Rally obedience offers more interaction with the owner and less repetition than traditional obedience trials.<sup id=""cite_ref-Holmes_26-0""> </sup> Australian Cattle Dogs have been successful in a range of dog sports including weight pulling, flyball and schutzhund. The breed is particularly suited to activities that a dog can share with its owner such as canicross, disc dog, and skijoring or bikejoring. It is an effective hiking companion because of its natural endurance, its general lack of interest in hunting, and preference for staying by its owner's side. Most Australian Cattle Dogs love the water and are excellent swimmers. It is not a hyperactive breed, and once one has had its exercise, it is happy to lie at its owner's feet, or to rest in its bed or crate while keeping an ear and eye open for signs of pending activity. The Australian Cattle Dog is an adaptable dog that can accept city or indoor living conditions, if its considerable exercise and companionship needs are met.<sup id=""cite_ref-Coren_8-1""> </sup> The Australian Cattle Dog can be put to work in a number of ways. Cattle Dogs are service dogs for people with a disability or are therapy dogs, some work for customs agencies in drug detection, some as police dogs, others haze pest animals, such as geese, for city or state agencies, and some work as scat-detection dogs, trackingendangered wildlife species.<sup id=""cite_ref-30""> </sup> <h2>Health and lifespan</h2> <h3>Lifespan</h3> In a small sample of 11 deceased dogs, Australian Cattle Dogs had a median longevity of 11.7 years (maximum 15.9 yrs). A larger survey of 100 deceased dogs yielded a mean longevity of 13.41 years with a standard deviation of 2.36 years.<sup id=""cite_ref-Pascal_Lee_Survey_32-0"">[31]</sup> The median longevities of breeds of similar size are between 11 and 13 years. There is an anecdotal report of a Cattle Dog named Bluey, born in 1910 and living for 29.5 years, but the record is unverified. Even if true, Bluey's record age would have to be regarded more as an uncharacteristic exception than as an indicator of common exceptional longevity for the entire breed. It remains, however, that Australian Cattle Dogs generally age well and appear to live on average almost a year longer than most dogs of other breeds in the same weight class. Many members of the breed are still well and active at 12 or 14 years of age, and some maintain their sight, hearing and even their teeth until their final days.<sup id=""cite_ref-Beauchamp_21-1""> </sup> <h3>Common health problems</h3> The Australian Cattle Dog carries recessive piebald alleles that produce white in the coat and skin and are linked to congenital hereditarydeafness, though it is possible that there is a multi-gene cause for deafness in a dog with the piebald pigment genes.<sup id=""cite_ref-35"">[34]</sup> Around 2.4% of Cattle Dogs in one study were found to be deaf in both ears and 14.5% were deaf in at least one ear. <sup id=""cite_ref-36""> </sup> The Australian Cattle Dog is one of the dog breeds affected by progressive retinal atrophy. It has the most common form, Progressive Rod/Cone Degeneration (PRCD), a condition that causes the rods and cones in the retina of the eye to deteriorate later in life, resulting in blindness. PRCD is an autosomal recessive trait and a dog can be a carrier of the affected gene without developing the condition. <sup id=""cite_ref-37""> </sup> Hip dysplasia is not common in the breed,although it occurs sufficiently often for many breeders to have their breeding stock tested. The Cattle Dog has a number of inherited conditions,but most of these are not common. Hereditary polioencephalomyelopathy of the Australian Cattle Dog is a very rare condition caused by an inherited biochemical defect. Dogs identified with the condition were completely paralysed within their first year.Based on a sample of 69 still-living dogs, the most common health issues noted by owners were musculoskeletal (spondylosis, elbow dysplasia, and arthritis) and reproductive (pyometra, infertility, and false pregnancy), and blindness. A study of dogs diagnosed at Veterinary Colleges in the US and Canada over a thirty-year period described fractures, lameness and cruciate ligament tears as the most common conditions in the Australian Cattle Dogs treated.<sup id=""cite_ref-Dorn_40-0""> </sup> <h2>History</h2> <h3>In Australia</h3> George Hall and his family arrived in the New South Wales Colony in 1802. By 1825, the Halls had established two cattle stations in theUpper Hunter Valley, and had begun a northward expansion into the Liverpool Plains, New England and Queensland. Getting his cattle to the Sydney markets presented a problem in that thousands of head of cattle had to be moved for thousands of kilometres along unfenced stock routes through sometimes rugged bush and mountain ranges. A note, in his own writing, records Thomas Hall's anger at losing 200 head in scrub.<sup id=""cite_ref-41""> </sup> A droving dog was needed, but the colonial working dogs are understood to have been of the Old English Sheepdog type, commonly referred to as Smithfields. Descendants of these dogs still exist, but are useful only over short distances and for yard work with domesticated cattle. Thomas Hall addressed the problem by importing several of the dogs used by drovers in Northumberland, his parents' home county. At that time dogs were generally described by their job, regardless of whether they constituted a breed as it is currently understood. In the manner of the time, the Hall family historian, A. J. Howard, gave these blue mottled dogs a name: Northumberland Blue Merle Drovers Dog.<sup id=""cite_ref-42""> </sup> Thomas Hall crossed his Drovers Dogs with dingoes he had tamed, and by 1840 was satisfied with his resulting progeny. During the next thirty years, the Halls Heelers, as they became known, were used only by the Halls. Given that they were dependent on the dogs, which gave them an advantage over other cattle breeders, it is understandable that the dogs were not distributed beyond the Hall's properties. It was not until after Thomas Hall's death in 1870, when the properties went to auction with the stock on them, that Halls Heelers became freely available.<sup id=""cite_ref-43""> </sup> By the 1890s, the dogs had attracted the attention of the <i>Cattle Dog Club of Sydney</i>, a group of men with a recreational interest in the new practice of showing dogs competitively. None were stockmen working cattle on a daily basis, and initially they were interested in a range of working dogs, including the Smithfield. They reportedly adopted the term ""Australian Cattle Dog"" to refer to the dogs being bred from bloodlines originating from Thomas Hall's 'heelers', and prominent members of the group concentrated on breeding these lines. Of these breeders, the Bagust family was the most influential. Robert Kaleski, of Moorebank, a young associate of Harry Bagust, wrote ""in 1893 when I got rid of my cross-bred cattle dogs and took up the blues, breeders of the latter had started breeding ... to fix the type. I drew up a standard for them on those lines"".This first breed standard for the Cattle Dog breed was published, with photographs, by the New South Wales Department of Agriculture in 1903.<!--more--><sup id=""cite_ref-ADB_46-0""> </sup> Kaleski's standard was adopted by breed clubs in Queensland and New South Wales and re-issued as their own, with local changes. His writings from the 1910s give an important insight into the early history of the breed. However, dog breeder and author Noreen Clark has noted that his opinions are sometimes just that, and he introduces some contradictory assertions in his later writings, as well as some assumptions that are illogical in the light of modern science.Some of these have persisted; for example he saw the red colour form as having more dingo in it than the blue form, and there is a persistent belief that reds are more vicious than blues. The most enduring of Kaleski's myths relate to Dalmatianand Kelpie infusions into the early Cattle Dog breed. These infusions are not referred to in Kaleski's writings until the 1920s and it seems likely that Kaleski sought to explain the Cattle Dog's mottled colouration and tan on legs by similarity to the Dalmatian and Kelpie, respectively. The genetics of coat colour, and the current understanding of hereditary characteristics, make the infusion of Dalmatian to increase the cattle dog's tolerance of horses an extremely unlikely event. There were relatively few motor vehicles in Australia at the beginning of the 20th century, so most dogs of any breed would have been accustomed to horses.The Kelpie breed was developed after the Cattle Dog type was described, so its infusion is unlikely.It is possible that there was some infusion of Bull Terrier but there is no verifiable record of this, and the Cattle Dog has not had the Bull Terrier's instinct to bite and hold, which would have been an undesirable trait.Early in the 1900s there was considerable in-fighting amongst members of the Cattle Dog Club, and a series of arguments about the origin of the breed appeared in newspapers and journals of the time. While many of these arguments were misleading, some irrational, and the majority not supported by historical facts, they continue to be circulated,resulting in a number of theories on the origins of the breed. In recent years, information technology enabling the manipulation of large databases combined with advances in the understanding of canine genetics has allowed a clearer understanding of the development of the breed.<sup id=""cite_ref-52""> </sup> Through the 1890s, Cattle Dogs of Halls Heeler derivations were seen in the kennels of exhibiting Queensland dog breeders such as William Byrne of Booval, and these were a different population from those shown in New South Wales. When Royal Shows resumed after World War II, Sydney exhibitors saw <i>Little Logic</i> offspring for the first time and these dogs and their sires' show record created a demand in New South Wales for <i>Little Logic's</i> lineage. By the end of the 1950s, there were few Australian Cattle Dogs whelped that were not descendants of <i>Little Logic</i> and his best known son, <i>Logic Return</i>. The success and popularity of these dogs led to the growth of the nickname ""Queensland Heeler"".<sup id=""cite_ref-53""> </sup> The prominence of <i>Little Logic</i> and <i>Logic Return</i> in the pedigrees of modern Australian Cattle Dogs was perpetuated by Wooleston Kennels. For some twenty years, Wooleston supplied foundation and supplementary breeding stock to breeders in Australia, North America and Continental Europe. As a result, <i>Wooleston Blue Jack</i> is ancestral to most, if not all, Australian Cattle Dogs whelped since 1990 in any country.<sup id=""cite_ref-54""> </sup> <h3>In the United States</h3> <div> <div> <div>US soldiers met the Cattle Dog mascots of Australian divisions overseas. This puppy is being bathed in preparation for a visit by General Douglas MacArthur.</div> </div> </div> In the 1940s Alan McNiven, a Sydney veterinarian, introduced Dingo, Kelpie, German Shepherd, and Kangaroo Hound into his breeding program; however, the Royal Agricultural Society Kennel Club (RASKC) would not register the cross breeds as Australian Cattle Dogs, even though McNiven argued they were true to conformation, colour and temperament. McNiven responded by giving his pups registration papers from dead dogs, and was consequently expelled from the RASKC and all of his dogs removed from the registry. Meanwhile, Greg Lougher, a Napa, California cattle rancher who met Alan McNiven while stationed in Australia during World War II, had imported several adults and several litters from McNiven. After his de-registration McNiven continued to export his 'improved' dogs to the US. Many US soldiers who were stationed in Queensland or NSW during the War discovered the Australian Cattle Dog and took one home when they returned.<sup id=""cite_ref-Ekman_55-0""> </sup> In the late 1950s a veterinarian in Santa Rosa, California, Jack Woolsey, was introduced to Lougher's dogs. With his partners, he bought several dogs and started breeding them. The breeders advertised the dogs in <i>Western Horsemen</i> stating they were guaranteed to work and calling them Queensland Heelers. Woolsey imported several purebred Australian Cattle Dogs to add to his breeding program, including <i>Oaklea Blue Ace</i>, <i>Glen Iris Boomerang</i> and several Glen Iris bitches. The National Stock Dog Registry of Butler, Indiana, registered the breed, assigning American numbers without reference to Australian registrations.<sup id=""cite_ref-Ekman_55-1""> </sup> Australian Cattle Dogs had been classified in the ""miscellaneous"" category at the American Kennel Club (AKC) since the 1930s; to get the breed full recognition, the AKC required that a National Breed Parent Club be organised for promotion and protection of the breed.<sup id=""cite_ref-Ekman_55-2"">[54]</sup>In 1967 Esther Ekman met Chris Smith-Risk at an AKC show, and the two fell into conversation about their Australian Cattle Dogs and the process of establishing a parent club for the breed. By 1969 the fledgling club had 12 members and formally applied to the AKC for instructions. One of the requirements was that the Club had to start keeping its own registry for the breed and that all dogs on the registry would have to be an extension of the Australian registry, tracing back to registered dogs in Australia.The AKC Parent Club members began researching their dogs, including exchanging correspondence with McNiven, and discovered that few of them had dogs that could be traced back to dogs registered in Australia. The AKC took over the club registry in 1979 and the breed was fully recognised in September 1980. The Australian Cattle Dog Club of America is still active in the promotion of the breed and the maintenance of breed standards. The National Stock Dog Registry continued to recognise Cattle Dogs without prerequisite links to Australian registered dogs, on the condition that any dog of unknown parentage that was presented for registry would be registered as an 'American Cattle Dog', and all others would still be registered as 'Australian Cattle Dogs'.<sup id=""cite_ref-Ekman_55-4""> </sup> <h3>In Canada</h3> The breed gained official recognition from the Canadian Kennel Club in January 1980 after five years of collecting pedigrees, gathering support, and lobbying officials by two breeders and enthusiasts. The small number of Australian Cattle Dogs in Canada at the time were primarily working dogs on farms and ranches scattered across large distances. However, the fledgling breed club held conformation shows, obedience and agility competitions, and entered their dogs in sports including flyball and lure coursing. At the end of 1980, <i>Landmaster Carina</i> was named the first Australian Cattle Dog in Canada to gain both her conformation and obedience titles.<sup id=""cite_ref-Redhead_56-1""> </sup> [button link=""http://alphamatch.com/listing-type/pets/?pet-type=1081&amp;breed-2=28",NULL,NULL,NULL,"Y","0"

They are medium-sized dogs and come in a variety of colours. Kelpies have been exported throughout the world and are used to muster livestock, primarily sheep, cattle and goats. The breed has been separated into two distinct varieties: the show or bench Kelpie and the working Kelpie.The show Kelpie is seen at conformation dog shows in some countries and is selected for appearance rather than working instinct. Working Kelpies are bred for working ability rather than appearance. The Kelpie is a smooth-coated, medium sized dog generally with prick ears and an athletic appearance. Working Kelpies are bred for work and endurance, rather than physical appearance. Coat colors include: black, black and tan, red, red and tan, blue, blue and tan, fawn, fawn and tan, and cream (yellow). Kelpies generally weigh 14?20 kilograms (31?44 lb) and measure 41?51 centimetres (16?20 in) at the withers.<sup id=""cite_ref-2""> </sup> <h3>Breed standards</h3> Robert Kaleski published the first standard for the Kelpie in 1904. The standard was accepted by leading breeders of the time and adopted by the Kennel Club of New South Wales.Contemporary breed standards vary depending on whether the registry is for working or show Kelpies. It is possible for a dog to both work and show, but options for competition in conformation shows might be limited depending on ancestry and the opinions of the kennel clubs or breed clubs involved. In Australia, there are two separate registries for Kelpies. <i>Working Kelpies</i> are registered with the Working Kelpie Council (WKC), which is the primary authority on the breed standard, and/or the State Sheepdog Workers Association. The WKC encourages breeding for working ability, and allows a wide variety of coat colours. The wide standards allowed by the WKC mean that Working Kelpies do not meet the standard for showing. <i>Show Kelpies</i> are registered with the Australian National Kennel Council, which encourages breeding for a certain appearance and limits acceptable colours. Only Show Kelpies may be shown in Australia.<sup id=""cite_ref-4""> </sup> [button link=""http://alphamatch.com/listing-type/pets/?pet-type=1081&amp;breed-2=3156"" color=""black"" type=""big-button"" type=""Search for Australian Kelpie""]Search for Australian Kelpie[/button] &nbsp; <h4>Breed standards outside Australia</h4> In the USA, the Kelpie is not recognised as a breed by the American Kennel Club (AKC).The North American Australian Kelpie Registry, which promotes the dog as a working breed, does not want<sup>[<i>citation needed</i>]</sup> the breed to be promoted by the AKC. Kelpies are recognised by the United Kennel Club (UKC) in the United States and may compete in UKC events. Kelpies are also recognised by the Canadian Kennel Club (CKC) in Canada and may compete in CKC events. The Svenska Working Kelpie Klubben also does not permit <i>Working Kelpies</i> to be shown. <h3>Working Kelpies</h3> The <i>working Kelpie</i> comes in three coat types: smooth, short, and rough. The coat can be almost every colour from black through light tan or cream. Some Kelpies have a white blaze on the chest, and a few have white points. Kelpies sometimes have a double coat, which sheds out in spring in temperate climates. Agouti is not unusual, and can look like a double coat. Working Kelpies vary in size, ranging from about 19 inches to as much as 25 inches and from 28-60 lbs. The dog's working ability is unrelated to appearance, so stockmen looking for capable working dogs disregard the dog's appearance. A <i>working Kelpie</i> can be a cheap and efficient worker that can save farmers and graziers the cost of several hands when mustering livestock.The good working Kelpies are herding dogs that will prevent stock from moving away from the stockman.This natural instinct is crucial when mustering stock in isolated gorge country, where a good dog will silently move ahead of the stockman and block up the stock (usually cattle) until the rider appears. The preferred dogs for cattle work are Kelpies, often of a special line, or a Kelpie cross.They will drive amob of livestock long distances in extremes of climates and conditions. Kelpies have natural instincts for managing livestock. They will work sheep, cattle, goats, pigs, poultry, and other domestic livestock. The Kelpie's signature move is to jump on the backs of sheep and walk across the tops of the sheep to reach the other side and break up the jam. A good working Kelpie is a versatile dog?they can work all day on the farm, ranch, or station, and trial on the weekends. Kelpies compete and are exhibited in livestock working trials, ranging from yards or arenas to large open fields working sheep, goats, cattle, or ducks.<sup id=""cite_ref-Sloane_9-0""> </sup> <h2>Show Kelpies</h2> <i>Show Kelpies</i> are restricted to solid colours (black, chocolate, red, smoky blue, fawn, black and tan, red and tan) in a short double coat with pricked ears. It was during the early 20th century that Kelpies were first exhibited, at the Sydney Royal Easter Show.Different kennel clubs'breed standards have preferences for certain colours. Show Kelpies are generally heavier and shorter than working Kelpies.<sup> </sup> <h2>Temperament</h2> Show Kelpies generally excel in agility trials and may be shown in conformation in Australia. 'Riley', an Australian Kelpie, set the world record for dog jumping when he jumped 2.95 metres at the Casterton, Victoria Kelpie Festival. In his previous 30 high jumping competitions he was defeated only twice.<sup id=""cite_ref-10""> </sup> <h2>Health</h2> Kelpies are a hardy breed with few health problems, but they are susceptible to disorders common to all breeds, like cryptorchidism, hip dysplasia, cerebellar abiotrophy and luxating patella. Current research is underway to find the genetic marker for cerebellar abiotrophy in the breed.<sup> </sup> [button link=""http://alphamatch.com/listing-type/pets/?pet-type=1081&amp;breed-2=3156"" color=""black"" type=""big-button"" type=""Search for Australian Kelpie""]Search for Australian Kelpie[/button] &nbsp; <h2>History</h2> <div> <div>Sign at Ardlethan, New South Wales, claiming the town as ""The home of the Kelpie""</div> </div> The ancestors of the Kelpie were simply (black) dogs, called Colleys or Collies. The word ""collie"" has the same root as ""coal"" and ""collier (ship)"".Some of these collies were imported to Australia for stock work in the early 19th century, and were bred to other types of dogs (possibly including the occasional Dingo), but always with an eye to working sheep without direct supervision. Today'sCollie breeds were not formed until about ten or 15 years after the Kelpie was established as a breed, with the first official Border Collie not brought to Australia until after Federation in 1901.<sup id=""cite_ref-14""> </sup> Kelpies have been claimed to have some Dingo blood; as it was illegal to keep dingoes as pets, some dingo owners registered their animals as Kelpies or Kelpie crosses. Kelpies and dingoes are similar in conformation and colouring.There is no doubt that some people have deliberately mated dingoes to their Kelpies, and some opinion holds that the best dilution is 1/16?1/32, but that 1/2 and 1/4 will work. As the Dingo has been regarded as a savage sheep-killer since the first white settlement of Australia, few will admit to the practice.<sup id=""cite_ref-cross_15-1""> </sup> The first ""Kelpie"" was a black and tan female pup with floppy ears bought by Jack Gleeson about 1872 from a litter born on Warrock Station near Casterton, owned by George Robertson, a Scot. This dog was named after the mythological kelpie from Celtic folklore. Legend has it<span style=""font-size: 11px;""> </span> that ""Kelpie"" was sired by a dingo, but there is little evidence for or against this. In later years she was referred to as ""(Gleeson's) Kelpie"", to differentiate her from ""(King's) Kelpie"", her daughter. The second ""Kelpie"" was ""(King's) Kelpie"", another black and tan bitch out of ""Kelpie"" by ""Caesar"", a pup from two sheep-dogs imported from Scotland. Again, there are legends that these two sheep-dogs may never have seen Scotland, and may have had dingo blood. ""(King's) Kelpie"" tied the prestigious Forbes Trial in 1879,and the strain was soon popularly referred to as ""Kelpie's pups"", or just Kelpies. The King brothers joined another breeder, McLeod, to form a dog breeding partnership whose dogs dominated trials during 1900 to 1920.<sup id=""cite_ref-ReferenceA_16-1""> </sup> An early Kelpie, Sally was mated to Moss a smooth haired Collie and she produced a black pup that was named Barb after the black horse, The Barb who won the Melbourne Cup in 1866.

The first and most famous was John Quinn's Red Cloud in the early 20th century, and then in the 1960s another ""Red Cloud"" that became very well known in Western Australia. This started the tradition in Western Australia of calling all red or red and tan Kelpies, especially those with white chests, Red Cloud Kelpies.<sup id=""cite_ref-19""> </sup> Kelpies have now been exported to many countries including, Argentina, Canada, Italy, Korea, New Caledonia, New Zealand, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United Statesfor various pursuits.<sup id=""cite_ref-Sloane_9-3""> </sup> <div>Kelpie circa 1915</div> Recently Kelpies have been trained as scent dogs with good success rates.

The breed was developed in Australia, although the ancestral types and breeds were from Great Britain. It is closely related to the Australian Terrier and the Yorkshire Terrier. The breed is called the <i>Silky Terrier</i> in North America, but is called the <i>Australian Silky Terrier</i> in its country of origin and in the rest of the world. <h2>Appearance</h2> The Australian Silky Terrier is a small and compact short legged terrier, 23 to 26 cm (9.1 to 10 in) at the withers, alert and active. The long silky grey and white or blue and tan coat is an identifying feature, hanging straight and parted along the back, and described as ""flat, fine and glossy"".All proportions and aspects of the body and head as well as desirable shades of grey and white and placement of markings are extensively described in the breed standard.<sup id=""cite_ref-2""> </sup> The Silky Terrier should be slightly longer than tall (about one fifth longer than the height at withers). This is a dog that was historically used for hunting and killing rodents and snakes, so its body should have enough substance to fit this role. The coat requires quite a lot of regular grooming and shampooing to retain its silkiness. The Silky Terrier has a strong, wedge-shaped head. The eyes are small and almond-shaped. According to the standards, light-colored eyes are considered a fault. The ears are small and carried erect. The Silky Terrier has a high-set tail and small, almost catlike, feet. The coat should be long, but not so long to approach floor length. The hair on the face and ears is normally cut. <h2>History</h2> The ancestors of the Australian Silky Terrier include the Yorkshire Terrier and the Australian Terrier (which descends from the rough coated type terriers brought from Great Britain to Australia in the early 19th century); few records indicate whether early dogs were just Australian Terriers born with silky fur, or whether there was an attempt to create a separate breed.According to the American Kennel Club, the breed began at the end of the 19th century when were crossed with the Australian Terriers.At first the breed was known as the Sydney Silky, as it was found primarily in the city of Sydney, Australia.Although most other Australian breeds were working dogs, the Silky Terrier was bred primarily to be an urban pet and companion, although it is also known for killing snakes in Australia.<sup id=""cite_ref-Clark.2FBrace_3-1""> </sup> Up until 1929 the Australian Terrier, the Australian Silky Terrier, and the Yorkshire Terrier were not clearly defined. Dogs of three different breeds might be born in the same litter, to be separated by appearance into the different types once they were grown.After 1932 in Australia, further crossbreeding was discouraged, and in 1955 the breed's name officially became the Australian Silky Terrier.

Records of working dogs are scarce from this time period, and there are several different accounts of the breed's development. One is that a drover named Timmins from Bathurst, New South Wales, crossed the Smithfield dogs with the dingo, producing a type of working dog called Timmin's Biters.In order to mute their dingo characteristics and make the dogs easier to handle, further crosses were made with Scottish smooth collies, producing speckled red and blue dogs that were often born tailless. In the book <i>A Dog Called Blue</i>, author Noreen Clark makes the case that both the tailless Australian Stumpy Tail Cattle Dog and the Australian Cattle Dog descended from the same stock, called Halls Heelers, kept in the 1830s by a very large cattle operation run by Thomas Hall. The dogs which were also crosses of Smithfield Cattle Dogs and dingo, but the breeds diverged at some point in the late 19th century.Selective breeding of the tailless or short tailed dogs has fixed the characteristic of today's breed.A summary of both versions of the breed's history is found in the F",NULL,NULL,NULL,"Y","0"

Fur is shorter on the muzzle, lower legs, and feet, and there is a ruff around the neck.

The UK Kennel Club has a 2004 survey, but it has a much smaller sample size than the Australian Terrier Club of America surveys.Some of the respondents in the American surveys were from Australia, but there is no separate Australian health survey. <h2>Mortality</h2> In both 1997 and 2002 Australian Terrier Club of America surveys, median longevity of Australian Terriers was 11 years (total sample size of 230 deceased dogs).In the Kennel Club (UK) 2004 survey, median longevity was 12.1 years, but the sample size was only 11 deceased dogs. 11 years is a typical median longevity for purebred dogs in general, but on the low end of longevities for breeds similar in size to Australian Terriers.<sup id=""cite_ref-Cassidy_Weight_8-0""> </sup> Major causes of death in the 2002 survey were cancer (67%), old age (17%), undetermined (16%), and diabetes (13%).<sup id=""cite_ref-ATCA_survey_5-2""> </sup> <h2>Morbidity</h2> Among 619 living dogs in the 2002 Australian Terrier Club of America survey, the most commonly reported health problems were endocrine (primarily diabetes), allergic dermatitis, and musculoskeletal (primarily luxating patella and ruptured cranial cruciate ligament).Other conditions reported among more than 4% of the surveyed dogs were adult onset cataracts and ear infections.The much smaller 2004 UKC survey, with 28 living dogs, suggested similar health concerns. <sup id=""cite_ref-KC_Survey_7-2""> </sup> <h2>Temperament</h2> The breed standard describes the ideal Australian Terrier temperament as spirited, alert, ""with the natural aggressiveness of a ratter and hedge hunter"".Aussies rank 34th in Stanley Coren's <i>The Intelligence of Dogs</i>, being of above average ""Working and Obedience"" intelligence, indicating good trainability.As with other terriers, they can be dog-aggressive and somewhat bossy, and care must be taken when living in a multi-pet household.

For example, a short, flat back combined with long legs place the hips higher than the withers. The Azawakh is almond eyed and thin. It moves with a distinctly feline gait and can be found in a variety of colors as well as varying degrees of refinement, though format is basically constant. <h3>Height and weight</h3> The standards call for a hound from 33 to 55 pounds (15 to 25 kg); its height is 24 to 29 inches (61 to 74 cm). The coat is very short and almost absent on the belly. Its bone structure shows clearly through the skin and musculature. Its muscles are ""dry"", meaning that they lie quite flat, unlike the Greyhound and Whippet. In this respect it is similar in type to the Saluki. <h3>Colors</h3> In Africa, Azawakh are found in a variety of colors such as red, blue fawn (that is, with a lilac cast), grizzle, and, rarely, blue and black. The Azawakh in its native land also comes with various white markings including Irish marked (white collar) and particolour (mostly white).Because of this wide color variation in the native population, the American standard used by the AKC and UKC allows any color combination found in Africa. In the United States, the FCI standard is modified to have no color restrictions at a minimum and there is a strong sentiment that the FCI standard should be heavily edited or replaced.<sup id=""cite_ref-2""> </sup> Colors permitted by the FCI breed standard are clear sand to dark fawn/brown, red and brindle (with or without a dark mask), with white bib, tail tip, and white on all feet (which can be tips of toes to high stockings). Currently, white stockings that go above the elbow joint are considered disqualifying features in France, as is a white collar or half collar (Irish marked). <h3>Movement</h3> The Azawakh's light, supple, lissome gait is a notable breed characteristic, as is an upright double suspension gallop. <h2>Health</h2> Azawakhs are an incredibly sound coursing hound. Serious coursing injuries are rare. The dogs heal very quickly from injury. Azawakh have no known incidence of hip dysplasia. There is a small occurrence of adult-onset idiopathic epilepsy in the breed. Wobbler disease, or cervical vertebral instability, does rarely occur. Some breeders believe this is largely a developmental problem where puppies grow too quickly due to a high-protein Western diet.<sup>[<i>citation needed</i>]</sup> <h2>Reproduction</h2> Like the Basenji and Tibetan Mastiff, the Azawakh often has a single annual estrus. Unassisted birth of healthy puppies is normal. Litter sizes are usually from four to six puppies, but litters as small as one and as large as ten occur. <h2>Care</h2> Azawakh need a fairly high level of exercise and should have regular runs off lead in large enclosed areas to run off steam. The dogs are very social and emotional. They need a master that provides firm but fair leadership. Azawakh thrive on companionship of other Azawakh. <h2>Temperament</h2> Unlike other sighthounds, the primary function of the Azawakh in its native land is that of protector. It develops an intense bond with his owner, yet can perform independently from its master. With those they accept, Azawakh are gentle and extremely affectionate. With strangers many are reserved and prefer not to be touched, but are not inherently aggressive. Although raised to protect livestock, they do not have innate aggression toward canine nor human unless they are threatened. Azawakh have high energy and tremendous endurance. They are excellent training companions for runners and are nearly impervious to heat. They will happily run in weather over 100 degrees Fahrenheit that would kill a Greyhound. They often dig holes in the garden. Many Azawakh dislike rain and cold weather. Azawakh are pack oriented and form complex social hierarchies. They have tremendous memories and are able to recognize each other after long periods of separation. They can often be found sleeping on top of each other for warmth and companionship.<sup id=""cite_ref-3""> </sup> <h2>History</h2> Bred by the Tuareg, Fula and various other nomads of the Sahara and sub-Saharan Sahel in the countries of Mali, Niger, Burkina Faso, and southern Algeria, the breed is used there as a guard dog and to hunt gazelle and hare at speeds up to 40 miles per hour. The austerity of the Sahel environment has ensured that only the most fit dogs survive and has accentuated the breed's ruggedness and independence. Unlike some other sighthounds, the Azawakh is more of a pack hunter and they bump down the quarry with hindquarters when it has been tired out. In role of a guard dog, if an Azawakh senses danger it will bark to alert the other members of the pack, and they will gather together as a pack under the lead of the alpha dog, then chase off or attack the predator. The Sloughi, by comparison, is more of an independent lone hunter and has a high hunting instinct. They are relatively uncommon in Europe and North America but there is a growing band of devotees. Azawakhs have a range of temperaments from lap dog to quite fierce. Lifelong socialization and firm but gentle handling are critical. Well socialised and trained, they can be good with other dogs, cats, children, and strangers. Azawakh may be registered with the FCI in the USA via the Federaci",NULL,NULL,NULL,"Y","0"

It is believed that they originated from Central European shepherd dogs. <h2>Appearance</h2> These dogs are well proportioned, with strong, rectangular bodies and trotter features. Their eyes are oval and are brown or amber. Their ears are medium sized, triangular and sometimes show folds. The vivid yellow medium length rough coat is longer over the trunk than over the head and is shorter on the face, but does not hide the eyes. The relation between height and length is about 1/1.2. The head is rather light relative to the trunk, which is attached by a short neck and muscular. Of the two distinct types of Basque Shepherd Dog, the more outgoing Gorbeikoa is the more pure and ancient of the two. It is recognized by the distinct cinnamon colored moderate length hair coat. <h2>History</h2> This sheepdog is one of the oldest dog breeds. Skeletal remains were found in Neolithic caves dated to 12,000 years ago. They are interpreted as demonstrating that the people living in the area of what is now Basque Country were shepherds. In frescoes and paintings of the sixteenth century there are representations of the Basque Shepherd Dog. Nevertheless, their recognition has required extensive research on records from throughout the Basque Country. Only after demonstrating their differences from other breeds such as the Pyrenean Shepherd and the Catalan sheepdog, did the Royal Canine Society of Spain recognize the Basque Shepherd Dog as a breed with two varieties: Iletsua and Gorbeikoa, in January 1996. <h2>Activities</h2> The Basque Shepherd Dog can compete in dog agility trials, obedience, Rally obedience, Schutzhund, showmanship, flyball, tracking, and herding events.

Wire-coated, the coat is very harsh to the touch, dense, red-wheaten or fawn. He measures 32 ? 38 cm in height and weighs between 36 - 40 lbs but due the old, and no longer permitted, practice of registering mixed litters of Griffon and Basset Fauves sometimes a litter of bassets will produce a long legged dog more akin to the Griffon. They have coarse, dense fur which may require stripping. The hair on the ears is shorter, finer and darker than that on the coat. The ears just reach the end of the nose rather than trailing on the ground and should be pleated. They should have dark eyes and nose and ideally no crook on the front legs. The French standard says these are the shortest backed of all the basset breeds so they generally do not appear as exaggerated as the British Basset. <h2>Health</h2> There is apparently only one completed health survey of Basset Fauve de Bretagnes, a 2004 UK Kennel Club survey with a small sample size. The French Basset Fauve de Bretagne kennel club, Club du Fauve de Bretagne (<a href=""http://fauvedebretagne.free.fr/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fauvedebretagne.free.fr/</a> - in French), is currently (as of July 15, 2007) conducting a health survey, but the questionnaire asks owners about all of their dogs collectively (rather than each individual dog) and does not ask about longevity. The UK Club is planning a new, in depth health survey to be run late 2012 early 2013 in the hope that the longevity can be more accurately represented. <h3>Mortality</h3> Based on a small sample size of 15 deceased dogs, Basset Fauve de Bretagnes in the 2004 UK Kennel Club survey had a median longevity of 10.4 years (maximum 13.9 years), which is a typical median longevity for purebred dogs, but a little low compared to other breeds of similar size. Most common causes of death were road traffic accidents, cancer, heart failure, and kidney failure. The high incidence of road traffic accidents may be perhaps blamed on this dog's love of the scent. Many pet Fauves go AWOL when they find a scent and this character trait is something an owner must never forget. Fauves can be trained very well in a controlled environment but training is rapidly forgotten once a fresh rabbit trail is found. <h3>Morbidity</h3> Among 84 live dogs in the 2004 UKC survey, the most common health issues noted by owners were reproductive, aural (otitis media and otitis externa), and ocular (corneal ulcers and cataracts).<sup id=""cite_ref-KC_Survey_2-3""><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basset_Fauve_de_Bretagne#cite_note-KC_Survey-2""> </a></sup> <h2>History</h2> The breed was developed in France as a hunting dog from the larger Grand Fauve de Bretagne, a breed that is now extinct.

Their sense of smell for tracking is second only to that of the Bloodhound. The name <i>Basset</i> is derived from the French word <i>bas</i>, meaning ""low"", with the attenuating suffix <i>-et</i>, together meaning ""rather low"". Basset Hounds are usually Bicolors or Tricolors of standard hound coloration. <h2>Description</h2> <h3>Appearance</h3> Bassets are large, short, solid and long, with curved sabre tails held high over their long backs. Everett Millais, founder of the modern Basset Hound, is quoted as saying ""Oh, he's about 4 feet long and 12 inches high."" in reference to his French basset. An adult dog weighs between 20 and 35 kilograms (44 and 77 lb). This breed, like its ancestor the Bloodhound, is known for its hanging skin structure, which causes the face to occasionally look sad; this, for many people, adds to the breed's charm. The dewlap, seen as the loose, elastic skin around the neck, and the trailing ears which along with the Bloodhound are the longest of any breed, help trap the scent of what they are tracking. Its neck is wider than its head. This combined with the loose skin around its face and neck means that flat collars can easily be pulled off. The previous FCI standard described the characteristic skin of the Basset, which resembles its ancestor the Bloodhound as ""loose"". This wording has since been updated to ""supple and elastic"". The looseness of the skin results in the Basset's characteristic facial wrinkles. The Basset's skull is characterized by its large Dolichocephalic nose, which is second only to the Bloodhound in scenting ability and number of olfactory receptor cells. <div></div> The Basset's short legs are due to a form of dwarfism. Their short stature can be deceiving; Bassets are surprisingly long and can reach things on table tops that other dogs of similar height can not. Because Bassets are so heavy and have such short legs, they are not able to hold themselves above water for very long when swimming, and should always be closely supervised in the water. <h4>Coat</h4> The short-haired coat of a Basset is long, smooth and soft, and sheds constantly. Any hound coloration is acceptable, but this varies from country to country. They are usually Black, Tan and White tricolors or Tan and White bicolors. Tan can vary from reddish-brown and Red to Lemon. Lemon and White is less common color. Some Bassets are also classified as gray or blue - this color is considered rare and some consider it undesirable. They usually have a clearly defined white blaze and a white tip to their tail, intended to aid hunters in finding their dogs when tracking through underbrush. <h3>Temperament</h3> <div> <div>Basset Hounds are renowned for their gentle, docile demeanor.<sup id=""cite_ref-DorothyHardy_2-0""> </sup></div> </div> The Basset Hound is a friendly, outgoing, playful dog. He is an excellent companion for children because of his patient nature and tolerance. He can be extremely tolerant of children and other pets but like all dogs, he will require space and time to relax in privacy, away from screaming children and ear tugs. Commonly misconceived as ""stubborn"", in actuality basset hounds are extremely food driven and easy to train. Bassets are quick to shut down if trained using punishment-based training methods and therefore are given the description of ""stubborn"". The fastest way to a Basset's heart is through his stomach. Keep training fun and interesting and offer delicious treats to keep them focused on the task at hand since that nose can distract them very easily. Bassets are scent hounds. Therefore you cannot expect them to ignore an interesting smell. Unless your basset has a very strong recall, he should be on a leash when out on daily walks to ensure his safety. Even though Bassets are content to sleep most of the day, regular exercise and mental stimulation are necessary for your basset to thrive and stay healthy. A large, fenced backyard and daily walks with opportunity to put their nose to work while on a long lead would be a perfect example of the outdoor and exercise requirements for a basset. Bassets are known to be a vocal breed. They have a wide range of entertaining sounds and a deep howl. <h2>Health</h2> <h3>Ears</h3> Basset Hounds have large pendant ears(known as ""leathers"") that do not allow air to circulate inside them, like other breeds with erect or more open ears. This can result in infections and ear mites if their ears are not kept clean and dry. If their ears are allowed to dangle on the ground or in food on a daily basis, they may develop chronic and potentially fatal ear diseases. Young puppies trip over their long ears and may bite their ears accidentally if they dangle in their food. This can lead to infection if they break the skin. Regular cleaning of the inside and outside of the ears, including the removal of excess ear wax, is necessary to prevent infections. <h3>Short Stature</h3> The Basset Hound's short stature is due to a genetic condition known as Osteochondrodysplasia (meaning abnormal growth of both bone and cartilage). Dwarfism in dogs is traditionally known as Achondroplasia. Basset Hounds, Dachshunds and Bulldogs are a few of the dog breeds classified as Achondroplastic.<sup id=""cite_ref-6""> </sup><sup id=""cite_ref-7""></sup> Basset Hound puppies, or very old dogs, should not be allowed to jump down from a height, due to how low they are to the ground. Because of a basset's body build (short stubby legs, low to the ground), if they fall too far, they can hurt their hips, injure their spine or break a leg. Many aging bassets have been euthanized due to such injuries. If a puppy sustains one of these injuries, the damage can be permanent. <h3>Other</h3> In addition to ear problems, basset hounds may be susceptible to eye issues. Because of their droopy eyes, the area under the eyeball will collect dirt and become clogged with a mucus. It is best to wipe their eyes every day with a damp cloth. This helps to lessen the build-up and prevent eye irritation. Bassets are bred for endurance. They need plenty of exercise and a good diet, free of grains and fillers to avoid potential food allergies and skin conditions. Being overweight leads to paralysis in Bassets. Basset Hounds are prone to yeast infections in the folds around the mouth, where drool can collect without thoroughly drying out. Wiping the area with a clean, dry towel and applying talcum powder can minimize this risk. The only recent mortality and morbidity surveys of Basset Hounds are from the UK: a 1999 longevity survey with a small sample size of 10 deceased dogs and a 2004 UK Kennel Club health survey with a larger sample size of 142 deceased dogs and 226 live dogs. See <b>Mortality</b> and <b>Morbidity</b> below. <h3>Mortality</h3> Median longevity of Basset Hounds in the UK is about 11.3 years, which is a typical median longevity for purebred dogs and for breeds similar in size to Basset Hounds. The oldest of the 142 deceased dogs in the 2004 UK Kennel Club survey was 16.7 years. Leading causes of death in the 2004 UK Kennel Club survey were cancer (31%), old age (13%), GDV bloat/torsion (11%), and cardiac (8%). <h3>Morbidity</h3> Among the 226 live Basset Hounds in the 2004 UKC survey, the most-common health issues noted by owners were dermatologic (e.g., dermatitis), reproductive, musculoskeletal (e.g., arthritis and lameness), and gastrointestinal (e.g. GDV and colitis).<sup id=""cite_ref-KC_Survey_10-2"">[10]</sup> Basset Hounds are also prone to epilepsy, glaucoma, luxating patella, thrombopathia, Von Willebrand disease, hypothyroidism, hip dysplasia, and elbow dysplasia. <h2>History</h2> The earliest-known depictions of short-legged hunting dogs are engravings from the Middle Kingdom of Egypt.<sup id=""cite_ref-12"">[12]</sup> Mummified remains of short-legged dogs from that period have been uncovered in the Dog Catacombs of Saqqara, Egypt. Scent Hounds were used for hunting in both Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome. <h3>St Hubert's Hound</h3> The basset type originated in France, and is descended from the 6th century hounds belonging to St Hubert of Belgium, which through breeding at the Benedictine Abbey of St. Hubert eventually became what is known as the St Hubert's Hound around 1000AD. St Hubert's original hounds are descended from the Laconian (Spartas) Hound, one of four groups of dogs discerned from Greek representations and descriptions. These scent hounds were described as large, slow, 'short-legged and deep mouthed' dogs with a small head, straight nose, upright ears and long neck, and either tan with white markings or black with tan markings. Laconian Hounds were reputed to not give up the scent until they found their prey. They eventually found their way to Constantinople, and from there to Europe.<sup id=""cite_ref-CampbellThornton_14-1""> </sup> <h3>France</h3> The first mention of a ""basset"" dog appeared in La Venerie, an illustrated hunting text written by Jacques du Fouilloux in 1585. The dogs in Fouilloux's text were used to hunt foxes and badgers. It is commonly believed that the Basset type originated as a mutation in the litters of Norman Staghounds, a descendant of the St Hubert's Hound. These precursors were most likely bred back to the St. Hubert's Hound, among other derivative French hounds. Until after the French Revolution around the year 1789, hunting from horseback was the preserve of kings, large aristocratic families and of the country squires,and for this reason short-legged dogs were highly valued for hunting on foot. Basset type hounds achieved noticeable public cultural popularity during the reign of Emperor Napoleon III (r. 1852-1870). In 1853,Emmanuel Fremiet, ""the leading sculptor of animals in his day"" exhibited bronze sculptures of Emperor Napoleon III's basset hounds at the Paris Salon. Ten years later in 1863 at the first exhibition of dogs held in Paris, basset hounds attained international attention.<sup id=""cite_ref-18""> </sup> The controlled breeding of the short haired basset began in France in the year 1870. From the existing Bassets, Count Le Couteulx of Canteleu fixed a utilitarian type with straight front legs known as the Chien d'Artois, whereas Mr. Louis Lane developed a more spectacular type, with crooked front legs, known as the Basset Normand. These were bred together to create the original Basset Art",NULL,NULL,NULL,"Y","0"

Small hounds are mentioned in the Forest Laws of <a title=""Canute the Great"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canute_the_Great"">Canute</a> which exempted them from the ordinance which commanded that all dogs capable of running down a <a title=""Deer"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deer"">stag</a> should have one foot mutilated. If genuine, these laws would confirm that beagle-type dogs were present in England before 1016, but it is likely the laws were written in the <a title=""Middle Ages"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Ages"">Middle Ages</a> to give a sense of antiquity and tradition to Forest Law.<sup id=""cite_ref-4""><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beagle#cite_note-4""> </a></sup> In the 11th century, <a title=""William I of England"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_I_of_England"">William the Conqueror</a> brought the <a title=""Talbot (dog)"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talbot_(dog)"">Talbot hound</a> to Britain. The Talbot was a predominantly white, slow, deep-throated, scent hound derived from the <a title=""St. Hubert Hound"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Hubert_Hound"">St. Hubert Hound</a> which had been developed in the 8th century. At some point the English Talbots were crossed with <a title=""Greyhound"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greyhound"">Greyhounds</a> to give them an extra turn of speed. Long extinct, the Talbot strain probably gave rise to the Southern Hound which, in turn, is thought to be an ancestor of the modern day Beagle.<sup id=""ref_Bnone""><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beagle#endnote_Bnone""> </a></sup> From medieval times, <i>beagle</i> was used as a generic description for the smaller hounds, though these dogs differed considerably from the modern breed. Miniature breeds of beagle-type dogs were known from the times of <a title=""Edward II of England"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_II_of_England"">Edward II</a> and <a title=""Henry VII of England"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_VII_of_England"">Henry VII</a>, who both had packs of Glove Beagles, so named since they were small enough to fit on a glove, and <a title=""Elizabeth I of England"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_I_of_England"">Queen Elizabeth I</a> kept a breed known as a Pocket Beagle, which stood 8 to 9 inches (20 to 23 cm) at the shoulder. Small enough to fit in a ""pocket"" or saddlebag, they rode along on the hunt. The larger hounds would run the prey to ground, then the hunters would release the small dogs to continue the chase through underbrush. Elizabeth I referred to the dogs as her <i>singing beagles</i> and often entertained guests at her royal table by letting her Pocket Beagles cavort amid their plates and cups. 19th-century sources refer to these breeds interchangeably and it is possible that the two names refer to the same small variety. In George Jesse's <i>Researches into the History of the British Dog</i> from 1866, the early 17th-century poet and writer <a title=""Gervase Markham"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gervase_Markham"">Gervase Markham</a> is quoted referring to the Beagle as small enough to sit on a man's hand and to the: <blockquote>little small mitten-beagle, which may be companion for a ladies kirtle, and in the field will run as cunningly as any hound whatere, only their musick is very small like reeds.<sup id=""cite_ref-7""><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beagle#cite_note-7""> </a></sup></blockquote> Standards for the Pocket Beagle were drawn up as late as 1901; these genetic lines are now extinct, although modern breeders have attempted to recreate the variety.<sup id=""cite_ref-PB_8-0""><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beagle#cite_note-PB-8""> </a></sup> <h3>Eighteenth century</h3> By the 18th century two breeds had been developed for hunting hare and rabbit: the <a title=""Southern Hound"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Hound"">Southern Hound</a> and the <a title=""North Country Beagle"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Country_Beagle"">North Country Beagle</a> (or Northern Hound). The Southern Hound, a tall, heavy dog with a square head, and long, soft ears, was common from south of the <a title=""River Trent"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Trent"">River Trent</a> and probably closely related to the <a title=""Talbot (dog)"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talbot_(dog)"">Talbot Hound</a>. Though slow, it had stamina and an excellent scenting ability. The North Country Beagle, possibly a cross between an offshoot of the Talbot stock and a Greyhound, was bred chiefly in <a title=""Yorkshire"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yorkshire"">Yorkshire</a> and was common in the northern counties. It was smaller than the Southern Hound, less heavy-set and with a more pointed muzzle. It was faster than its southern counterpart but its scenting abilities were less well developed.<sup id=""cite_ref-9""><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beagle#cite_note-9"">[9]</a></sup> As <a title=""Fox hunting"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_hunting"">fox hunting</a> became increasingly popular, numbers of both types of hound diminished. The beagle-type dogs were crossed with larger breeds such as Stag Hounds to produce the modern <a title=""English Foxhound"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Foxhound"">Foxhound</a>. The beagle-size varieties came close to extinction but some farmers in the South ensured the survival of the prototype breeds by maintaining small <a title=""Rabbit-hunting"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbit-hunting"">rabbit-hunting</a> packs. <h3>Development of the modern breed</h3> Reverend Phillip Honeywood established a Beagle pack in <a title=""Essex"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essex"">Essex</a> in the 1830s and it is believed that this pack formed the basis for the modern Beagle breed. Although details of the pack's lineage are not recorded it is thought that North Country Beagles and Southern Hounds were strongly represented; <a title=""William Youatt"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Youatt"">William Youatt</a> suspected that <a title=""Harrier (dog)"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrier_(dog)"">Harriers</a> formed a good majority of the Beagle's bloodline, but the origin of the Harrier is itself obscure. Honeywood's Beagles were small, standing at about 10 inches (25 cm) at the shoulder, and pure white according to John Mills (writing in <i>The Sportsman's Library</i> in 1845). <a title=""Albert, Prince Consort"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert,_Prince_Consort"">Prince Albert</a> and <a title=""Edward Turnour, 4th Earl Winterton"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Turnour,_4th_Earl_Winterton"">Lord Winterton</a> also had Beagle packs around this time, and royal favour no doubt led to some revival of interest in the breed, but Honeywood's pack was regarded as the finest of the three.<sup id=""cite_ref-11""><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beagle#cite_note-11""> </a></sup> Although credited with the development of the modern breed, Honeywood concentrated on producing dogs for hunting and it was left to Thomas Johnson to refine the breeding to produce dogs that were both attractive and capable hunters. Two strains were developed: the rough- and smooth-coated varieties. The rough-coated Beagle survived until the beginning of the 20th century, and there were even records of one making an appearance at a dog show as late as 1969, but this variety is now extinct, having probably been absorbed into the standard Beagle bloodline.<sup id=""cite_ref-K7_12-0""><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beagle#cite_note-K7-12""> </a></sup> In the 1840s, a standard Beagle type was beginning to develop: the distinction between the North Country Beagle and Southern Hound had been lost, but there was still a large variation in size, character, and reliability among the emerging packs. In 1856, ""Stonehenge"" (the pseudonym of <a title=""John Henry Walsh"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Henry_Walsh"">John Henry Walsh</a>), writing in the <i>Manual of British Rural Sports</i>, was still dividing Beagles into four varieties: the medium Beagle; the dwarf or lapdog Beagle; the fox Beagle (a smaller, slower version of the Foxhound); and the rough-coated or terrier Beagle, which he classified as a cross between any of the other varieties and one of the Scottish <a title=""Terrier"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrier"">terrier</a> breeds. Stonehenge also gives the start of a standard description: <blockquote>In size the beagle measures from 10 inches, or even less, to 15. In shape they resemble the old southern hound in miniature, but with more neatness and beauty; and they also resemble that hound in style of hunting.<sup id=""cite_ref-S98_14-1""><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beagle#cite_note-S98-14""> </a></sup></blockquote> By 1887 the threat of extinction was on the wane: there were 18 Beagle packs in England. The Beagle Club was formed in 1890 and the first standard drawn up at the same time. The following year the Association of Masters of Harriers and Beagles was formed. Both organisations aimed to further the best interests of the breed, and both were keen to produce a standard type of Beagle. By 1902 the number of packs had risen to 44.<sup id=""cite_ref-K9_15-1""><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beagle#cite_note-K9-15""> </a></sup> <h3>Export</h3> Beagles were in the United States by the 1840s at the latest, but the first dogs were imported strictly for hunting and were of variable quality. Since Honeywood had only started breeding in the 1830s, it is unlikely these dogs were representative of the modern breed and the description of them as looking like straight-legged <a title=""Dachshund"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dachshund"">Dachshunds</a> with weak heads has little resemblance to the standard. Serious attempts at establishing a quality bloodline began in the early 1870s when General <a title=""Richard Rowett"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Rowett"">Richard Rowett</a> from <a title=""Illinois"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"">Illinois</a> imported some dogs from England and began breeding. Rowett's Beagles are believed to have formed the models for the first American standard, drawn up by Rowett, L. H. Twadell, and Norman Ellmore in 1887. The Beagle was accepted as a breed by the <a title=""American Kennel Club"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Kennel_Club"">American Kennel Club</a> (AKC) in 1884. In the 20th century the breed has spread worldwide. <h3>Popularity</h3> On its formation, the Association of Masters of Harriers and Beagles took over the running of a regular show at <a title=""Peterborough"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peterborough"">Peterborough</a> that had started in 1889, and the Beagle Club in the UK held its first show in 1896. The regular showing of the breed led to the development of a uniform type, and the Beagle continued to prove a success up until the outbreak of <a title=""World War I"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I"">World War I</a> when all shows were suspended. After the war, the breed was again struggling for survival in the UK: the last of the Pocket Beagles was probably lost during this time, and registrations fell to an all-time low. A few breeders (notably Reynalton Kennels) managed to revive interest in the dog and by <a title=""World War II"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II"">World War II</a>, the breed was once again doing well. Registrations dropped again after the end of the war but almost immediately recovered.<sup id=""cite_ref-19""><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beagle#cite_note-19""> </a></sup> As purebred dogs, Beagles have always been more popular in the United States and Canada than in their native country England . The National Beagle Club of America was formed in 1888 and by 1901 a Beagle had won a Best in Show title. As in the UK, activity during World War I was minimal, but the breed showed a much stronger revival in the U.S. when hostilities ceased.

The origin of the word ""beagle"" is uncertain, although it has been suggested that the word derives from the French <i>begueule</i> (meaning ""open throat"" from <i>bayer</i> ""open wide"" and <i>gueule</i> ""mouth"") or from an <a title=""Old English language"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_English_language"">Old English</a>, French, or the <a title=""Goidelic languages"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goidelic_languages"">Gaelic</a> word <i>beag</i>, meaning ""little."" Other possibilities include the French <i>beugler</i> (meaning ""to bellow"") and the German <i>begele</i> (meaning ""to scold""). It is not known why the black and tan <a title=""Kerry Beagle"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerry_Beagle"">Kerry Beagle</a>, present in Ireland since <a title=""Celt"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celt"">Celtic</a> times, has the <i>beagle</i> description, since at 22 to 24 inches (56 to 61 cm) it is significantly taller than the modern day Beagle, and in earlier times was even larger. Some writers suggest that the Beagle's scenting ability may have come from cross-breeding earlier strains with the Kerry Beagle. Originally used for hunting stags, it is today used for hare and <a title=""Drag hunting"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_hunting"">drag hunting</a>. <h2>Description</h2> <h3>Appearance</h3> The general appearance of the Beagle resembles a miniature <a title=""Foxhound"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foxhound"">Foxhound</a>, but the head is broader and the muzzle shorter, the expression completely different and the legs shorter in proportion to the body. They are generally between 13 and 16 inches (33 and 41 cm) high at the <a title=""Withers"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Withers"">withers</a> and weigh between 18 and 35 lb (8.2 and 15.9 kg), with females being slightly smaller than males on average.<sup id=""cite_ref-27""><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beagle#cite_note-27""> </a></sup> They have a smooth, somewhat domed <a title=""Skull"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skull"">skull</a> with a medium-length, square-cut <a title=""Snout"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snout"">muzzle</a> and a black (or occasionally liver), gumdrop nose. The jaw is strong and the teeth scissor together with the upper teeth fitting perfectly over the lower teeth and both sets aligned square to the jaw. The eyes are large, hazel or brown, with a mild hound-like pleading look. The large ears are long, soft and low-set, turning towards the cheeks slightly and rounded at the tips. Beagles have a strong, medium-length neck (which is long enough for them to easily bend to the ground to pick up a scent), with little folding in the skin but some evidence of a <a title=""Dewlap"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dewlap"">dewlap</a>; a broad chest narrowing to a tapered <a title=""Abdomen"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"">abdomen</a> and waist and a short, slightly curved tail (known as the ""stern"") tipped with white. The white tip, known as the flag has been selectively bred for, as it allows the dog to be easily seen when its head is down following a scent. The tail does not curl over the back, but is held upright when the dog is active. The Beagle has a muscular body and a medium-length, smooth, hard coat. The front legs are straight and carried under the body while the rear legs are muscular and well bent at the <a title=""Stifle joint"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stifle_joint"">stifles</a>.<sup id=""cite_ref-29""><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beagle#cite_note-29""> </a></sup> <h3>Colouring</h3> Beagles appear in a range of colors. Although the tricolour (white with large black areas and light brown shading) is the most common, Beagles can occur in any hound colour. Tricoloured dogs occur in a number of shades, from the ""Classic Tri"" with a jet black saddle (also known as ""Blackback""), to the ""Dark Tri"" (where faint brown markings are intermingled with more prominent black markings), to the ""Faded Tri"" (where faint black markings are intermingled with more prominent brown markings). Some tricoloured dogs have a broken pattern, sometimes referred to as <i>pied</i>. These dogs have mostly white coats with patches of black and brown hair. Tricolour Beagles are almost always born black and white. The white areas are typically set by eight weeks, but the black areas may fade to brown as the puppy matures. (The brown may take between one and two years to fully develop.) Some Beagles gradually change colour during their lives, and may lose their black markings entirely. Two-colour varieties always have a white base colour with areas of the second colour. Tan and white is the most common two-colour variety, but there is a wide range of other colours including lemon, a very light tan; red, a reddish, almost orange, brown; and liver, a darker brown, and black. Liver is not common and is not permitted in some standards; it tends to occur with yellow eyes. Ticked or mottled varieties may be either white or black with different coloured flecks (<i>ticking</i>), such as the blue-mottled or bluetick Beagle, which has spots that appear to be a midnight-blue colour, similar to the colouring of the <a title=""Bluetick Coonhound"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetick_Coonhound"">Bluetick Coonhound</a>. Some tricolour Beagles also have ticking of various colours in their white areas.<sup id=""cite_ref-30""><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beagle#cite_note-30""> </a></sup><sup id=""cite_ref-31""></sup> <h3>Sense of smell</h3> Alongside the <a title=""Bloodhound"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloodhound"">Bloodhound</a> and <a title=""Basset Hound"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basset_Hound"">Basset Hound</a>, the Beagle has one of the best developed senses of smell of any dog. In the 1950s, John Paul Scott and John Fuller began a 13-year study of canine behaviour. As part of this research, they tested the scenting abilities of various breeds by putting a mouse in a one-<a title=""Acre"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acre"">acre</a> field and timing how long it took the dogs to find it. The Beagles found it in less than a minute, while <a title=""Fox Terrier"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Terrier"">Fox Terriers</a> took 15 minutes and <a title=""Scottish Terrier"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Terrier"">Scottish Terriers</a> failed to find it at all. Beagles are better at ground-scenting (following a trail on the ground) than they are at air-scenting, and for this reason they have been excluded from most <a title=""Mountain rescue"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_rescue"">mountain rescue</a> teams in favour of <a title=""Collie"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collie"">collies</a>, which use sight in addition to air-scenting and are more biddable.

Males are around 21?22 inches (53?56 cm) tall at the withers while females are around 20?21 inches (51?53 cm) tall.<sup id=""cite_ref-1""> </sup> [button link=""http://alphamatch.com/listing-type/pets/?pet-type=1081&amp;breed-2=4265"" color=""black"" type=""big-button"" type=""Search for Bearder Collie""]Search for Bearded Collie[/button] &nbsp; <h2>History</h2> The Bearded Collie's history is a mix of fact and legend. Kazimierz Grabski, a Polish merchant, reportedly traded a shipment of grain for sheep in Scotland in 1514 and brought six Polish Lowland Sheepdogs to move them. A Scottish shepherd was so impressed with the herding ability of the dogs that he traded several sheep for several dogs. The Polish sheepdogs were bred with local Scottish dogs to produce the Bearded Collie. It is generally agreed that Mrs. G. Olive Willison founded the modern Bearded Collie in 1944 with her brown bitch, Jeannie of Bothkennar. Jeannie was supposedly a Shetland Sheepdog, but Mrs. Willison received a Bearded Collie by accident. She was so fascinated by the dog that she wanted to begin breeding, so she began searching for a dog for Jeannie. While walking along the beach, Mrs. Willison met a man who was emigrating from Scotland; she became the owner of his grey dog, David, who became Bailie of Bothkennar. Bailie and Jeannie of Bothkennar are the founders of the modern breed; there are only a few other registrable blood lines, preserved in large part by the perseverance of Mr. Nicolas Broadbridge (Sallen) and Mrs. Betty Foster (Bredon). These are based on Turnbull's Blue?a Bearded Collie from pure working stock, registered in ISDS when ISDS still registered non-Border Collies. He sired three litters of registerable Bearded Collies. The breed became popular during the last half of the 20th century?propelled, in part, by Potterdale Classic at Moonhill, a Bearded Collie who won Best in Show at Crufts in 1989. The Bearded Collie Club celebrated its Golden Jubilee in 2005.The bearded collie is also very good natured and is good as a family pet and a working dog and a show dog. <h2>As pets</h2> The Bearded Collie ranks 117 out of 175 breeds in popularity in the United States, according to the American Kennel Club's yearly breed ranking.A Bearded Collie is best obtained from a reputable breeder or a dog rescue. There are Beardie rescue associations, such as Beardie Collie Rescue and ""Rescue Me"". These organisations attempt to place unwanted puppies and dogs into appropriate, loving homes. Most Bearded Collie breeders take great care in breeding, raising and placing their puppies. Due to this, Bearded Collies are considered an ""unspoiled"" breed.<sup id=""cite_ref-9""> </sup> Bearded Collies make excellent pets for those willing to accommodate their high energy level and grooming requirements. Weekly brushing is mandatory for keeping their long hair mat-free. Some Bearded Collie owners opt to keep their pets in a ""puppy cut"" haircut, which reduces (but does not eliminate) the need for brushing. Bearded Collies are an energetic breed, originally intended to work in theScottish Highlands herding sheep; they also excel at dog agility and Obedience trials. A loyal and family-friendly dog, the Beardie can add years of pet-ownership enjoyment to the home. They have keen problem-solving abilities, and are entertaining to watch. Female Beardies are often more outgoing and headstrong than males. In training, males are more likely to follow instructions and females are more independent. Females often become the alpha dog if there is a male and female Beardie in the household. Regardless of the Beardie's sex, they are a very active breed. One of the most common problems for new Beardie owners is the breed's advanced age of maturity; standard puppy issues last longer, and Beardies frequently fail ""puppy school"" if entered at the same age as other breeds. <h2>Working life</h2> The Bearded Collie is used to herd both sheep and cattle. It is essentially a working dog?bred to be hardy and reliable, able to stand up to the harshest conditions and the toughest sheep. The working Bearded Collie has become less common in the last few decades and might have died out; however, thanks to the efforts of a few shepherds like Tom Muirhead and Peter Wood (and breeders like Brian Plummer) the ""working Beardie"" has survived and is becoming more popular. It has been exported to Australia and the United States, and finds favour among those looking for an independent and intelligent sheepdog. The Working Bearded Collie Society's mission is to preserve the working abilities of non-registered working dogs from ""bearded"" ancestors. The website Shepherds with beardies has much valuable information on the small population of working Beardies. The KC-registered Bearded Collie has fallen into disfavour with the shepherds of Wales, Scotland and elsewhere because of the show-breeding community's lack of interest in producing ""hardy and reliable"" animals; show-bred lines tend to develop excessive coats, in particular. However, in some countries (notably Sweden and the United States) herding programmes have been developed for the breed. The breed organisations in those countries actively encourage breeders to emphasise qualities other than appearance. The Bearded Collie may have earned its nickname ""bouncing Beardie"" because the dogs would work in thick underbrush on hillsides; they would bounce to catch sight of the sheep. Beardies also have a characteristic way of facing a stubborn ewe, barking and bouncing on the forelegs. Whatever the reason, a typical Bearded Collie is an enthusiastic herding dog which requires structure and care; it moves stock with body, bark and bounce as required. Very few Beardies show ""eye"" when working; most are upright. Herding instincts and tractability can be assessed in noncompetitive herding tests. Beardies exhibiting basic herding instincts can be trained to compete in herding trials.<sup id=""cite_ref-Hartnagle-Taylor_and_Ty_Taylor_10-0""> </sup> <h2>Health</h2> <h3>Mortality</h3> The median longevity (the age at which half of the population has died and half is still alive) of Bearded Collies from recent UK and USA/Canada surveys (the weighted average of all surveys) is 12.8 years; Beardies in the UK surveys lived longer (median ~13.4 years) than their USA/Canada counterparts (median 12.0 years). Most purebred breeds have median longevities between 10 and 13 years and most breeds similar in size to Bearded Collies have median longevities between 11 and 13 years, so the lifespan of Bearded Collies appears to be on the high end compared with other breeds (at least in the UK). Individual dogs may die much earlier or later than the median. In a 1996 USA/Canada survey, 32% of Beardies died (including accidental deaths) before the age of nine; however, 12% lived longer than 14 years. The eldest of the 278 deceased dogs in the 2004 UK Kennel Club survey died at 19.5 years; the age at death of the oldest dog in the USA/Canada survey was not reported. Leading causes of death among Beardies in the UK are old age (26%), cancer (19%), cerebrovascular disease (9%), and chronic kidney failure (8%). Leading causes of death among Beardies in the US and Canada are old age (18%), cancer (17%), kidney failure (8%), cerebrovascular disease(4%) and Addison's disease (4%).<sup id=""cite_ref-Beardie_Club_13-1""> </sup> [button link=""http://alphamatch.com/listing-type/pets/?pet-type=1081&amp;breed-2=4265"" color=""black"" type=""big-button"" type=""Search for Bearder Collie""]Search for Bearded Collie[/button] &nbsp; <h3>Morbidity</h3> Bearded Collie owners in the UK reported that the most common health issues among living dogs were musculoskeletal?mostly arthritis and cruciate ligament rupture (CLR)?gastrointestinal (primarily colitis and diarrhea) and urologic diseases. Beardie owners in the US and Canada reported that the most common health problems were hypothyroidism, cancer, Addison's disease, arthritis and skin problems. Morbidity in the two studies is not easily compared, however; the UK report grouped diseases, while the USA/Canada report ranked more specific conditions. <h3>Addison's Disease</h3> Beardie owners should be aware of the frequency of Addison's disease (insufficient production of glucocorticoids and/ormineralocorticoids in the adrenal cortex) in this breed. It occurs in at least 2%-3.4% of Beardies in the USA/Canada survey, and is the cause of death in at least 1% of Beardies in the UK survey. Although these numbers seem low compared with those of other health issues, the percentages are much higher than for the general dog population (0.1%) and Addison's is responsible for a disproportionate number of deaths among young dogs. Addison's is often undiagnosed, since early symptoms are vague and easily mistaken for other conditions. Bearded Collies with unexplained lethargy, frequent gastric disturbances, or an inability to tolerate stress should be tested for Addison's. Addison's can cause fatal sodium/potassium imbalances but, if caught early and treated with lifelong medication, most dogs can live a relatively normal life. <h2>Bearded Collies in Popular Culture</h2> <ul> <li>The role of Nana in the original production of the James Barrie play Peter Pan was performed by a Bearded Collie.</li> <li>Cole, is a Bearded Collie and is featured in the 2006 film, The Shaggy Dog.</li> <li>A Bearded Collie is also featured in the 2009 film, Hotel for Dogs.</li> </ul>",NULL,NULL,NULL,"Y","0"

The Groenendael is recognized by all major kennel clubs.<sup id=""cite_ref-kennel_2-0""> </sup> Like all Belgium Shepherd, the Groenendael is a medium-sized, hard-working, square-proportioned breed of dog in the sheepdog family. The Groenendael is recognized by its distinctive black coat. <h2>Description</h2> <h3>Appearance</h3> The Groenendael should be athletic, strong, imposing, rustic, and balanced in appearance. It should look natural, never as though it has been prepared just for the show ring. Its coat should be profuse, but never look as though it would inhibit the dog's working ability in any way. The colour is always black, with small white markings being allowed on the chest. When being shown, its handler should never have to force it into position; ideally the handler should not have to touch the dog at all. <h4>Size</h4> The Groenendael should be 60?66 centimetres (24?26 in) at the withers for males, and 56?62 centimetres (22?24 in) for females. The weight should be approximately 25?30 kilograms (55?66 lb) for males, and 20?25 kilograms (44?55 lb) for females. <h4>Coat</h4> The Groenendael has a thick, double coat. The texture should be hard and dense, never woolly, silky, frizzy, fine, or wiry. The undercoat should be thick and profuse. In conformation shows, dogs without an undercoat are heavily penalized. <h3>Temperament</h3> <div><span style=""font-size: 13px;"">The Groenendael is (very) intelligent, active, loyal and quietly affectionate. Groenendaels are not a breed for the faint of heart. However for those who have plenty of time, energy, confidence and love, they are wonderful friends. Training and socializing is essential. They are wary of strangers and protective. They love children as long as they are introduced to them at an early age. The Groenendael bonds deeply to its people and cannot live outdoors or in a kennel. It needs to spend time with its family every day and may experience separation anxiety if left alone for long periods of time.</span></div> <h2>Care</h2> The Groenendael needs a large amount of exercise as a rule. Expect to spend about two hours a day working with it. Exercise should include not only a walk, but also a training session to keep the dog mentally stimulated. These dogs have great ""work ethic"" and need a job to do, such as obedience, flyball, schutzhund training, dog agility or livestock work in order to be happy. They are a sensitive breed and cannot be trained using harsh training methods. They need thorough grooming once a week, however when shedding (which happens once or twice a year) they lose massive amounts of coat and need grooming every day. <h2>Health</h2> <h2>Activities</h2> Belgian Shepherds can compete in dog agility trials, obedience, showmanship, flyball, tracking, and herding events. Herding instincts and trainability can be measured at noncompetitive herding tests. Groenendael exhibiting basic herding instincts can be trained to compete in herding trials. One of the basic activities of the Belgian Shepherd was guarding the flock. This make that the Belgian shepherd is extremely useful for protection purposes. The Malinois is famous for its IPO or Policedog performance, but the Groenendael can also be used for this purpose.",NULL,NULL,NULL,"Y","0"

Its classification varies, being classified under some breed standards as a breed in its own right, and in others as one of several acceptable variations of the Belgian. It is usually listed within breed standards under one or other, or a combination, of these names. In the United States, since 1960, the AKC recognizes it under the name <b>Belgian Tervuren</b>. Prior to that date, all recognized varieties of the Belgians were called Belgian Sheepdog. In Canada, the Canadian Kennel Club recognizes the Tervuren as a variety of the Belgian Shepherd (prior to 2005, Belgian Shepherd Dogs were called Belgian Sheepdogs). [button link=""http://alphamatch.com/listing-type/pets/?pet-type=1081&amp;breed-2=2888"" color=""black""]Search for Belgian Shepherd Dog (Tervuran)[/button] &nbsp; <h2>Description</h2> <h3>Appearance</h3> Like all four of the Belgian Shepherds, the Tervuren is a medium-sized, square-proportioned dog in the Herding dog group. Males stand between 24 and 26 inches, and weigh approximately 65 lb. Bitches are finer and smaller. It is recognized by its thick double coat, generally mahogany with varying degrees of black overlay (completely missing overlay on males is a serious fault), including a black mask. A small patch of white on the chest is permissible, as well as white tips on toes. The Tervuren may also be sable or grey, but this may be penalized in the show ring in some countries according to the standard of the registering body. While the FCI permits any type of red (mahogany) coat including pale yellow (sand colour) and grey the AKC has stricter rules regarding colour. While the FCI states that fawn/mahogany is to be preferred, grey colour is a fault under AKC rules. <h2>Temperament</h2> Tervurens are highly energetic, intelligent dogs who require a job to keep them occupied. This can be herding, obedience, agility, flyball, tracking, or protection work. They are also found working as Search and Rescue (SAR) dogs, finding missing people and avalanche victims. Tervurens that are not kept sufficiently busy can become hyperactive or destructive. As companion animals, Tervurens are loyal and form strong bonds with their family, leading some to be shy around strangers. They are good watch dogs, being very observant and attentive to the slightest change in their environment. Some can be nervous, depending on breeding and early experiences, so care must be taken to adequately socialize. Tervuren puppies to a wide variety of people and situations. As with all the Belgian Shepherds, Tervurens are not generally recommended to first-time dog owners due to their high maintenance level. Adult males are distinctly masculine and females are likewise feminine. Their appearance projects alertness and elegance. The breed is known for its loyalty and versatility. Those who own them, report being charmed by their intelligence, trainability, and, perhaps most of all, their sense of humor. They excel in many kinds of activities. <h2>Activities</h2> Tervuren can compete in dog agility trials, obedience, showmanship, flyball, Schutzhund, tracking, and herding events. Herding instincts and train-ability can be measured at noncompetitive herding tests. Belgian Shepherds exhibiting basic herding instincts can be trained to compete in herding trials.<sup id=""cite_ref-Hartnagle-Taylor_and_Ty_Taylor_2-0""> </sup> <h2>Health</h2> Generally healthy, but Tervurens can have a susceptibility to hip dysplasia, epilepsy, gastric problems (including bloats and torsions) and some eye and skin problems. <h2>Grooming</h2> The Tervuren has a thick, double coat similar to the Groenendael. Regular brushing is necessary to remove loose undercoat, but in general, the fur is not prone to matting but occasionally, they can get hairballs. A properly textured Tervuren coat is slightly hard, laying flat against the body (unlike, for instance, the Samoyed's off-standing fur). It naturally sheds dirt and debris, but burrs and seeds may stick to the feathering on the legs. The Tervuren is shown in a natural state, with minimal trimming and cosmetic products. Bathing, brushing, and trimming the fur on the feet with scissors to emphasize their tight, cat-footed shape is the extent of most exhibitors' grooming routines. Products that alter the coloration of the coat and masking are not allowed in the ring.

[button link=""http://alphamatch.com/listing-type/pets/?pet-type=1081&amp;breed-2=1159"" color=""brown""]Search for Bergamasco Shepherd[/button] &nbsp; <h2>Appearance</h2> The Bergamasco is used in herding and guarding sheep and cattle. This ancient dog breed is found in the Italian Alps, especially in the region of Bergamasca valley. The Bergamasco should be a medium size dog, well-proportioned and harmonious, having a rustic appearance. The Bergamasco has a square body. It is a solidly compact dog with a strong, powerful build that gives it great resistance without taking away any of its agility and speed of movement. Males weigh 32?38 kilograms (71?84 lb) and females weigh 26?32 kilograms (57?71 lb). Their height is around 54?62 centimetres (21?24 in) and the life expectancy is 13?15 years. The rims of the lips are well pigmented. Scissor bite. The skull is broad and the eyes are dark chestnut color, ears are set high. The back is straight, well-muscled. The coat is dense abundant, long and dense, and the texture is harsh. The undercoat is short and dense. Muscles are well developed. In action the dog wags his tail. This breed dog can easily run long distances for a comparatively long time.<sup id=""cite_ref-1""> </sup> <h2>Coat and color</h2> The breed's most distinctive feature is the unusual felted coat, a normal and healthy characteristic of the breed. The coat is characterized by three types of hair: a fine, dense, oily undercoat, long harsher hairs similar to a goat's and a top woolly outer-coat. The three types of hair weave together as the dog gets older to form flat mats or flocks. The mats start from the spine and go down the flanks, growing every year to reach the ground. The color of the coat can be anything from an appearance of gray or silver gray (in fact a merle) to a mixture of black to coal, with brown shades also intermixed. These colors may have served as a camouflage when working in the mountains. Bergamascos are born with short, smooth fur, which slowly develops the characteristic mats as the dog grows. The coat is olid grey or with grey patches of all possible shades from a most delicate grey to a brighter shade of grey on to black; Isabel and light fawn shades are permitted. An all-black coat is allowed providing the black is really opaque. An all-white coat is prohibited. White patches are tolerated as long as their surface is not more than a fifth of the total surface of the coat.<sup id=""cite_ref-Hartnagle-Renna_3-0""> </sup> <h2>Temperament</h2> The Bergamasco is an alert, observant and patient dog breed with good self-control and balance. This breed is suited even as a guard and companion dog. The Bergamasco establishes close bond with his owner. Aggressive or overly shy behavior is a fault. <h2>Activities</h2> Bergamasco can compete in dog agility trials, obedience, showmanship, flyball, tracking, and herding events. Herding instincts and trainability can be measured at noncompetitive herding tests. Bergamasco exhibiting basic herding instincts can be trained to compete in herding trials.<sup id=""cite_ref-Hartnagle-Taylor_and_Ty_Taylor_4-0"">[4]</sup> The Bergamasco is still used in the Alps in Italy and in Switzerland to herd cattle. The cattlemen just let the dog go and the dog brings the herd back to the stable without human supervision. Bergamascos are often photographed herding sheep, but they are actually superb cattle dogs, who can perform in a mountain environment. <h2>Health</h2> Health information for this breed is sparse. The only health survey appears to be a 2004 UK Kennel Club survey, which had a sample size of 0 deceased dogs and 10 living dogs, far too few dogs from which to draw any conclusions.<sup id=""cite_ref-KC_Survey_5-0""> </sup> [button link=""http://alphamatch.com/listing-type/pets/?pet-type=1081&amp;breed-2=1159"" color=""brown""]Search for Bergamasco Shepherd[/button]",NULL,NULL,NULL,"Y","0"

These dogs nearly became extinct after both World War I and World War II and remain a rare breed to this day. This breed of dog is people-oriented, loyal, and can make a good family pet if properly socialized early in life. The producers of the 2005 American movie<i>Because of Winn-Dixie</i> brought five Picards over from Europe (""Scott"", ""Laiko"" and ""Tasha"" performed in the movie). The trainer wanted a dog that resembled the scruffy mutt on the original book's cover but needed several that looked alike so that production could continue smoothly, thus he decided on this rare purebred dog from France. It is this breed's rustic mutt-like appearance that has prevented it from being rapidly popularized and exploited in the United States by the movie release, as has been the fate of some other breeds. People are often fooled into thinking ""Winn-Dixie"" is a mixed breed. Like any breed of dog, the Picardy Shepherd is not for everyone, and much thought must be devoted to choosing the right dog. As more Picard puppies are imported into the U.S. from France and other countries, it is important that owners and future breeders remain responsible; they will determine the fate of this breed in the United States. In 2006 the Berger Picard Club of America was formed to help promote and protect this breed.

By and large, Picards are laid back and mellow but they are known for having a stubborn streak and being reserved towards strangers. They require a lot of socialization during the first two years of their lives. Picards are energetic and hard working, alert, loyal and sweet-tempered with children. They are happiest when they have a job to do. They also have a protective nature, making them good guard dogs. However, they are not excessive barkers. Some Picards are notoriously picky eaters, and it may be difficult to decide on a diet that you and the dog agree on. The breed also has a well-developed sense of humor, making them an endearing companion, and they continue to be used very effectively as both sheep and cattle herder in their native land and elsewhere.<sup id=""cite_ref-ReferenceA_3-0""> </sup> Like many herding breeds, Picards require human companionship and lots of it. Since they can be demonstrative to their owners and enthusiastic friends towards other animals, formal obedience training and plenty of positive socialization is a must. Athletic, loyal and filled with a desire to work a long day, the breed excels in any ""job"" as long as enthusiasm and praise is a part of the task. <h2>Health</h2> Berger Picards due to lack of over breeding are a relatively healthy, disease free breed. Hip dysplasia is known, as are several eye disorders, including progressive retinal atrophy or PRA. Eyes will be certified for hereditary diseases through the OFA as well (previously through the Canine Eye Research Foundation) and results should also be published on the OFA database. The breed's life expectancy is 12 to 13 years. <h2>Care</h2> <h3>Exercise and activities</h3> Bred to work the fields, Picards are very athletic and revel in exercise. A good deal of exercise is therefore a must for this breed. Otherwise boredom will give way to destructive behavior and rowdy play. They enjoy swimming, running beside a bike, and nice long walks. The Berger Picard makes an excellent jogging companion. The breed's intelligence and sensitivity have made it increasingly popular in dog sports such as agility trials, Tracking, obedience, showmanship, Schutzhund, Flyball, Lure coursing, French Ring Sport andherding events. Herding instincts and trainability can be measured at noncompetitive herding tests. Berger Picards exhibiting basic herding instincts can be trained to compete in herding trials. <h3>Living conditions</h3> Despite being more suited for being outdoors, Picards can do surprisingly well in city life provided they are given enough energy-releasing exercise. However, the Picard always tries to stay close to its owner and family, so when given a choice between being alone in a big yard or inside with its master the Picard would rather be with his ""shepherd."" Inside the house the Picard is usually a very quiet dog, waiting for its time to go out to run, play and sniff around. They are very loyal and enjoy a lot of attention and may suffer from separation anxiety (even if being left alone inside for short periods of time). <h3>Grooming</h3> The Berger Picard is a low maintenance dog. The rough, tousled coat can mat if not brushed on a regular basis (once every other week) but the coat does not require special care to yield its rustic appearance. Bathing is rarely done. Their fur should never be trimmed except maybe hand stripping the ears. They are not profuse shedders and have little ""doggie odor"". <h2>History</h2> Thought to be the oldest of the French Sheepdogs, the Berger Picard was brought to northern France and the Pas de Calais, in the 9th century by the Franks.<sup id=""cite_ref-J_SENECAT_1979_1-1""> </sup> Some experts insist that this breed is related to the more well-known Briard and Beauceron, while others believe it shares a common origin with Dutch and Belgian Shepherds. Although the Berger Picard made an appearance at the first French dog show in 1863, the breed's rustic appearance did not lead to popularity as a show dog.<sup id=""cite_ref-ReferenceA_3-1""> </sup> The breeding stock of the Berger Picard, was decimated by the ravages of World War I and World War II. With its population concentrated on the farms of north-eastern France, trench warfare in the Somme reduced the breed to near extinction.<sup id=""cite_ref-J_SENECAT_1979_1-2""> </sup> The Picard's easy care and mellow, yet mischievous, temperament have started the breed back on the road to recovery. Nevertheless its numbers are still limited, even in its native country. As mentioned previously, today in France there are approximately 3500 dogs and in Germany approximately 500 of this breed. At present there are approximately 300 Berger Picards in the United States and Canada. The Berger Picard was recognized by the United Kennel Club on January 1, 1994. In 2006, the Berger Picard Club of America was formed to protect and promote the breed in the United States. The Berger Picard has been recorded in the Foundation Stock Service of the American Kennel Club since April 2007. On October 12, 2011, The American Kennel Club chose the Berger Picard Club of America as the official parent club, as the breed moves towards full recognition. At the February 2012 Meeting of the American Kennel Club Board of Directors, the Board voted to move the Berger Picard into the Miscellaneous Group effective January 1, 2013. The Berger Picard is a recognized breed by the Canadian Kennel Club. It is in the Herding Group, Group 7. The Standard for this breed is available through the Canadian Kennel Club, Group 7 breed standards.

This mountain dog was originally kept as a general farm dog. Large Sennenhunds in the past were also used as draft animals, pulling carts. The breed was officially established in 1907. In 1937, the American Kennel Club recognized it as a member of the Working Group.<sup id=""cite_ref-AKCWorking_1-1""> </sup> [button link=""http://alphamatch.com/listing-type/pets/?pet-type=1081&amp;breed-2=2871"" color=""black"" type=""big-button"" type=""Search for Bernese Mountain Dog""]Search for Bernese Mountain Dog[/button] &nbsp; <h2>Appearance</h2> <h3>Four breeds of Sennenhund</h3> The four breeds of Sennenhund, with the original breed name, followed by the most popular English version of the breed name: <ul> <li>Grosser Schweizer Sennenhund, Greater Swiss mountain dog</li> <li>Berner Sennenhund, Bernese mountain dog</li> <li>Appenzeller Sennenhund, Appenzeller</li> <li>Entlebucher Sennenhund, Entlebucher mountain dog</li> </ul> <h3>Coloring</h3> Like the other Sennenhunds, the Bernese mountain dog is a large, heavy dog with a distinctive tri-colored coat, black with white chest and rust colored markings above eyes, sides of mouth, front of legs, and a small amount around the white chest. An ideal of a perfectly marked individual gives the impression of a white horse shoe shape around the nose and a white ?Swiss cross? on the chest, when viewed from the front. A ?Swiss kiss? is a white mark located typically behind the neck, but may be a part of the neck. A full ring would not meet type standard. The AKC breed standard lists, as disqualifications, blue eye color, and any ground color other than black. Exact color and pattern of the coat are also described as important. <h3>Height and weight ranges</h3> Height at the withers is 24?28 in (61?71 cm) for males, while it is 23?27 in (58?69 cm) for females. Weight is 85?110 lb (39?50 kg) for males, while it is 80?105 lb (36?48 kg) for females. <h3>Build and proportions</h3> The Bernese mountain dog is slightly longer than it is tall, and it is highly muscular. <h3>Other physical traits</h3> The head of the Bernese mountain dog is flat on the top with a moderate stop, and the ears are medium sized, triangular, set high, and rounded at the top. The teeth have a scissors bite. The legs of the Bernese are straight and strong, with round, arched toes. The dewclaws of the Bernese are often removed. Its bushy tail is carried low. <h2>Temperament</h2> The breed standard for the Bernese mountain dog states that dogs should not be ?aggressive, anxious or distinctly shy?, but rather should be ?good-natured?, ?self-assured?, ?placid towards strangers?, and ?docile?. The temperament of individual dogs may vary, and not all examples of the breed have been bred carefully to follow the standard. All large breed dogs should be well socialized when they are puppies, and given regular training and activities throughout their lives. Bernese are outdoor dogs at heart, though well-behaved in the house; they need activity and exercise, but do not have a great deal of endurance. They can move with amazing bursts of speed for their size when motivated. If they are sound (no problems with their hips, elbows, or other joints), they enjoy hiking and generally stick close to their people. Not being given the adequate amount of exercise may lead to barking and harassing in the Bernese.<sup id=""cite_ref-6""> </sup> Bernese mountain dogs are a breed that generally does well with children, as they are very affectionate.

The general impression is that of power, agility and alertness, with the ability to cover ground swiftly with powerful rhythmic strides. Each hound has its own distinctive voice which is often recognizable to its owners from great distance.

It is mellow, amiable, calm, and unobtrusive indoors. Outdoors, its strong hunting instincts take over, and it can be difficult to turn from a track after it starts trailing. As befitting a dog with its heritage, it is strong, independent, and stubborn. The Black and Tan Coonhound is gentle and tolerant with children, but it may be too independent to satisfy a playful child. It is reserved with strangers. It may bay and howl. <h2>Upkeep</h2> The Black and Tan is a dog that can run for miles, although it is usually content with a moderate jog or long walk, with an occasional excursion into the field. It can wander if it catches a scent, so a safe area is mandatory. Its coat needs only occasional brushing. Most Coonhounds drool to some extent, and the face may need regular wiping. The ears should also be checked regularly. <h2>History</h2> The Black and Tan Coonhound is descended from the Talbot hound, found in medieval England after the eleventh century. Its ancestry is then traced through the Bloodhound and the Foxhound to the Virginia Foxhound, commonly called the ""black and tan"".<sup id=""cite_ref-1""> </sup><sup id=""cite_ref-2""></sup> In 1945, the Black and Tan became the only one of the six varieties of Coonhound to be recognized in the Hound Group by the American Kennel Club. The Redbone Coonhound and the Plott Hound have since been recognized in the Miscellaneous Class. The other three varieties of Coonhound are the Bluetick Coonhound, the English Coonhound, and the Treeing Walker Coonhound. <h2>Notable Black and Tan Coonhounds</h2> <ul> <li>President George Washington had four Black and Tan Coonhounds: <b>Drunkard, Taster, Tipler, and Tipsy</b>.</li> </ul> [button link=""http://alphamatch.com/listing-type/pets/?pet-type=1081&amp;breed-2=249"" color=""black"" type=""big-button"" type=""Search for Black and Tan Coonhound""]Search for Black and Tan Coonhound[/button]",NULL,NULL,NULL,"Y","0"

It resulted of a cross breed with Bloodhounds in the 1700s. The breed was developed by the landed gentry in order to get a dog suitable for fox hunting, so most American foxhounds were born. Besides the Black and Tan there are the Walker, Calhoun, Penn-Marydel, Goodman, July and Trigg. The Black and Tan is believed to descend form hunting dogs imported to America by Robert Brooke in 1650. These hunting dogs were the ancestors of several varieties of American hounds and stayed with the Brooke family for more than 300 years. Afterwards French Foxhounds were bred in after George Washington received them as gifts from the Marquis de Lafayette. Much later, the breed's speed and stamina were improved introducing Irish Foxhounds.<sup id=""cite_ref-1""> </sup> <h2>Characteristics</h2> The American foxhounds are lighter, taller and more agile than the English ones. They can grow to a height of 21-25 inches and can weigh between 65 and 75 pounds. These dogs have a keen sense of smell and are faster than other hounds. They are large dogs with long, straight-boned front legs and a large skull with pendant ears which frame the face. They are wide and flat to the head. The eyes are wide set and large with a friendly and intelligent expression. The tail is set moderately high with a slight upward curve and the coat is hard and short, and as the name suggests, a combination of black and tan on a white base. These dogs are not suitable to apartment living because they need a lot of exercise and also tend to put on weight easily. Otherwise, they are fairly healthy and not plagued by genetic disorders involving the hip and bones. Their life span is about 10?12 years. This breed has a friendly, pleasant, loyal and reliable temperament.<sup id=""cite_ref-2""> </sup> <h2>Care</h2> Due to their energetic temperament they require a lot of exercise and room, if this is not provided they could become destructive in order to entertain themselves. This can also be prevented by a careful, patient training. They also need socialization outside. They are not suitable for apartment living because they are too energetic and need a lot of exercise to stay in shape.<sup id=""cite_ref-3""><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_and_Tan_Virginia_Foxhound#cite_note-3""> </a></sup> [button link=""http://alphamatch.com/listing-type/pets/?pet-type=1081&amp;breed-2=2063"" color=""black"" type=""big-button"" type=""Search for Black and Tan Virginia Foxhound""]Search for Black and Tan Virginia Foxhound[/button]",NULL,NULL,NULL,"Y","0"

It is bred for the same purpose as the Grey Norwegian Elkhound but is smaller, more agile, and easier to recognize in the snow. Historically, it is a much ""younger"" breed, first bred in Norway during the early 19th century. It is classified by the FCI as a hunting dog,although it is also used as a watchdog, guarddog and herder. The AKC breed name ""Elkhound,"" comes directly from its original Norwegian name ""Elghund,"" meaning ""moose dog."" In Norwegian, ""elg"" refers to the animal English speakers know as a ""moose"", and ""hund"" means ""dog.""

It has a rich coat that does not stand out from the body. This is an all-weather hunting dog and the coat is very important. It must be able to keep out the heavy autumn rain in Scandinavia and endure the cold weather, which it does very well. It has a dense, short, thick, course, double coat and is solid black. A mature dog stands between 40 and 51 centimeters (16""-20"") - 47 cm (+3/-4) for males and 44 cm (+3/-4) for females - and weighs between 16 kilograms (35 lb) and 20 kilograms (44 lb). <h3>Temperament</h3> The Black Norwegian Elkhound is a very robust and hardy dog: very alert and full of power and pride. It is more strong-minded than the Grey Elkhound. The most recommended training method is one that focuses on motivating the dog; such as clicker training or reward-based training methods. Using punishment or dominance-based methods could negatively impact training with the Black Norwegian Elkhound. It is easy to train, but always needs something to do to be happy. It needs continuous exercise and activity in concert with its superb intelligence to do well. It is an excellent hunting dog and loves to be in the forest. <h4>Hunting</h4> The Black Elkhound is used in all types of hunts but excels best in hunting large game such as elk, moose and bear. It is very good at tracking and makes an excellent watch dog. It is a good family dog but can sometimes be a bit contentious in relations with other dogs. The Elkhound has been an important dog for farmers in Scandinavia for hundreds of years. <h2>Care</h2> <h3>Grooming</h3> Its coat requires frequent brushing.

Solid black or white Black Mouth Cur do, on rare occasion, appear in a breeding. According to the United Kennel Club Standard, up to ten percent of the coat may be white with the amounts of white on the toes, tail, nose and chest considered acceptable. None of the Cur breeds are currently recognized breeds of the American Kennel Club (AKC). Aficionados describe the breed as ""a dog that is multitalented.

They can be a light solid color or a darker brindle. <b>Head</b>: The muzzle is square-shaped. It may have a melanistic mask, which is most often black. Maskless dogs are allowed but not preferred. The name 'Black Mouth' refers to the dark pigmentation around the lips that also extends into the interior of the mouth including the roof of the mouth, gums, and cheeks, excluding the tongue. The ears are medium-sized and hanging and may either be melanistic like the muzzle or the same color as the coat. The rarer dogs of hunting bloodlines tend to have the ears cropped soon after birth. <b>Tail</b>: The tail of a Black Mouth Cur is of medium length and is generally left natural, although it may also be docked. <b>Feet</b>: The feet are large and webbed, similar to a Catahoula Leopard Dog. <b>Size</b>: The adult weight ranges from 50-100 pounds, and 16-25 inches tall, with males being larger than females.

They are great social dogs if trained properly. The BMC is a ""very smart"" breed who ""by nature need to bond a few weeks"" with their owner/trainer before training can begin. The breed shows great loyalty and may even die for their owner. Great around children if introduced correctly, they have great potential to ""make wonderful family dogs."" As they grow older they become very laid back. ""The BMC was bred as a homestead dog that would protect its family and home against intruders. This means that a well-bred BMC is territorial. Most BMCs off their 'turf' work well with other dogs, hunting or herding stock, but on their family property will chase the same dog away. Their turf can be viewed by the dog as the family?s home, land, truck, or sometimes proximity to 'their person'."" <h2>Health</h2> <div> <div>Blackmouth Cur with a brindle coat</div> </div> Though many health issues affect dogs of all breeds and can affect the Black Mouth Cur, they seem to be a rather hardy breed. Their average life span is 12?16 years of age. As with other similar breeds, entropion (slight turning in of eyelid) is a correctable health issue. Their active nature exposes them to the possibility of torn ligaments and pulled muscles.<sup> </sup> <h2>Activities</h2> ""The BMC is genetically very athletic and eager to please. Given proper guidance and training, a BMC can excel in just about any activity you could imagine. They can herd animals, track or trail game, pull weights, run in a coursing event, work as a Search and Rescue dog, or anything else a smart, athletic dog that wants to please its owner can do."" Black Mouth Curs are used for herding cattle, baying hogs, hunting squirrel, raccoon, bear and mountain lion. All Black Mouth Curs excel at baying and herding. They will tree game. The Ladner line has specifically been bred to promote this treeing. The BMC is a very versatile dog and a single dog can be used to bay, herd, and tree depending upon the handler's desire. They have also been noted to be successful deer tracking dogs in the South. <h2>History</h2> Black Mouth Curs have varied historical documentation dependent upon region. Among them are the Ladner Yellow Black Mouth Cur from Mississippi, Red Black Mouth Cur from Alabama, Weatherford's Ben Black Mouth Cur from Texas, and the Florida Black Mouth Cur. The first Black Mouth Curs registered were Ladner Black Mouth Curs through the National Kennel Club in April 1964. Mr L.H. Ladner had such extensive written documentation of his family's breeding that the NKC recognized the breed. These curs are used to tree squirrel,raccoon, bobcat, mountain lion, and bear. They are used for hunting hogs and feral cattle. They also are distinguished by being used by the search and rescue emergency services.<sup id=""cite_ref-6""> </sup> The Weatherford's Ben Texas Black Mouth Cur comes from a line of curs well-documented in the book <i>Big Thicket Legacy</i>. They are used primarily for herding cattle. The Florida Black Mouth Cur, used for herding cattle, are featured in old paintings hanging in local barber shops and homes, so their existence and history in Florida is documented. The Red Alabama Black Mouth Cur is believed to have originated in Alabama, though there are Red Black Mouth Cur in Florida andTennessee. These cur were supposedly registered as property in the courthouses around Howardtown about 40 miles north of Mobile and nearby Tibbie in the 1940s. They were used as multipurpose pioneer dogs that would hunt, protect the home, and gather in the cattle and pigs at slaughter time. Several breeders in Alabama, Mrs. Murphy among them, continue to work toward retaining and improving the Red Black Mouth Cur. Through the efforts of several Black Mouth Cur breeders, the United Kennel Club later recognized the breed, featuring Howard Carnathan's Bruno, a Red Black Mouth Cur, in their standard photograph. Black Mouth Curs now range from the east to the west coast, and as far north as Canada. The Ladner Black Mouth Curs are also known to be in Mexico, Argentina, Haiti, Russia,India, and throughout Europe. Also very closely related to the Black Mouth Cur is the Mountain Cur.

They stand 58 to 69 cm (23 to 27 inches) high at the withers. Bloodhounds have a typical lifespan of about 9 to 11 years. According to the AKC standard of the breed, larger dogs are preferred by conformation judges. Acceptable colors for bloodhounds are black, liver, tan, or red. Bloodhounds possess an unusually large skeletal structure with most of their weight concentrated in their bones, which are very thick for their length. The coat typical for a scenthound is hard and composed of fur alone, with no admixture of hair. <h2>Temperament</h2> This breed is gentle, but is tireless when following a scent. Because of its strong tracking instinct, it can be willful and somewhat difficult to obedience train. Bloodhounds have an affectionate and even-tempered nature with humans, making excellent family pets. However, like any pet, they require supervision when around small children. <h2>Health</h2> <h3>Illnesses</h3> Compared to other purebred dogs, Bloodhounds suffer an unusually high rate of gastrointestinal ailments, with bloat being the most common type of gastrointestinal problem.<sup id=""cite_ref-KC_Survey_1-0"">[1]</sup> The breed also suffers an unusually high incidence of eye, skin, and ear ailments; thus these areas should be inspected frequently for signs of developing problems. Owners should be especially aware of the signs of bloat, which is both the most common illness and the leading cause of death of Bloodhounds. The thick coat gives the breed the tendency to overheat quickly. <h3>Lifespan and mortality</h3> Bloodhounds in a 2004 UK Kennel Club survey had a median longevity of 6.75 years, which makes them one of the shortest-lived of dog breeds. The oldest of the 82 deceased dogs in the survey died at the age of 12.1 years. Bloat took 34% of the animals, making it the most common cause of death in Bloodhounds. The second leading cause of death in the study was cancer, at 27%; this percentage is similar to other breeds, but the median age of death was unusually young (median of about 8 years).<sup id=""cite_ref-KC_Survey_1-3""> </sup> <h2>History</h2> <h3>Chien de Saint-Hubert</h3> The St Hubert was, according to legend, first bred ca. 1000 AD by monks at the Saint-Hubert Monastery in Belgium; its likely origins are in France, home of many of modern hounds. It is held to be the ancestor of several other breeds, like the extinct Norman hound, and Santongeois, and the modern Bleu de Gascogne, Gascon Santongeois, Ariegeois and Artois Normande, as well as the bloodhound. It has been suggested that it was a mixed breed, not at all uniform in type.<sup id=""cite_ref-Johnston_3-0""> </sup> Whether they originated there, or what their ancestry was, is uncertain, but from ca. 1200, the monks of the Abbey of St Hubert annually sent several pairs of black hounds as a gift to the King of France. They were not always highly thought of in the royal pack. Charles IX1550-74, preferred his white hounds and the larger Chiens-gris, and wrote that the St Huberts were suitable for people with gout to follow, but not for those who wished to shorten the life of the hunted animal. He described them as pack-hounds of medium stature, long in the body, not well sprung in the rib, and of no great strength. Writing in 1561 Jaques du Fouilloux describes them as strong of body, but with low, short legs. He says they have become mixed in breeding, so that they are now of all colours and widely distributed. Charles described the 'true race' of the St Hubert as black, with red/tawny marks above the eyes and legs usually of the same colour, suggesting a 'blanket' black and tan (see Section on Colour types below). To De Fouilloux the 'pure black' were the best of this mixed breed. Both writers thought them only useful as leash hounds. They both refer to a white hound, also a St Hubert, which by their time had disappeared, having been interbred with another white hound, the greffier, to produce the king?s preferred pack hound, sometimes called the chien blanc du roi. They appear to have been more highly thought of during the reign of Henry IV (1553?1610), who presented a pack to James I of England. By the end of the reign of Louis XIV (1715), they were already rare.In 1788, D?Yauville, who was master of the Royal hounds, says those sent by the St Hubert monks, once much prized, had degenerated, and scarcely one of the annual gift of six or eight was kept.<sup id=""cite_ref-Hounds_8-0""> </sup> Upon the French Revolution of 1789, the gifts ceased, and hunting in France went into a decline until the end of the Napoleonic wars. When it recovered during the 19th Century, huntsmen, with many breeds to choose from, seem to have had little interest in the St Hubert. An exception was Baron Le Couteulx de Canteleu, who tried to find them. He reported that there were hardly any in France, and those in the Ardennes were so cross-bred that they had lost the characteristics of the breed.<sup id=""cite_ref-Expo_7-1""> </sup><sup id=""cite_ref-Bloodhound_9-0""></sup> Writers on the bloodhound in the last two centuries generally agreed that the original St Hubert strain died out in the nineteenth century, and that the European St Hubert owes its present existence to the development of the Bloodhound.<sup id=""cite_ref-Manuel_6-1""> </sup><sup id=""cite_ref-Brey_11-0""></sup> <h3>Bloodhound</h3> References to bloodhounds first appear in English writing in the early to mid 14th century, in contexts that suggest the breed was well established by then.It is often claimed that its ancestors were brought over from Normandy by William the Conqueror, but there is no actual evidence for this. That the Normans brought hounds from Europe during the post-Conquest period is virtually certain, but whether they included the Bloodhound itself, rather than merely its ancestors, is a matter of dispute that probably cannot be resolved on the basis of surviving evidence. In Medieval hunting the typical use of the Bloodhound was as a ?limer?, or ?lyam-hound?, that is a dog handled on a leash or ?lyam?, to find the hart or boar before it was hunted by the pack hounds (raches). It was prized for its ability to hunt the cold scent of an individual animal, and, though it did not usually take part in the kill, it was given a special reward from the carcass.<sup id=""cite_ref-Turbervile_16-0""> </sup> It also seems that from the earliest times the Bloodhound was used to track people. There are stories written in Medieval Scotland of Robert the Bruce (in 1307), and William Wallace (1270?1305) being followed by 'sleuth hounds?.Whether true or not, these stories show that the sleuth hound was already known as a man-trailer, and it later becomes clear that the sleuth hound and the Bloodhound were the same animal. In the 16th century, John Caius,in unquestionably the most important single source in the history of the Bloodhound, describes its hanging ears and lips, its use in game parks to follow the scent of blood, which gives it its name, its ability to track thieves and poachers by their foot scent, how it casts if it has lost the scent when thieves cross water, and its use on the Scottish borders to track cross-border raiders, known as Border Reivers. This links it to the sleuth hound, and from Caius also comes the information that the English Bloodhound and the sleuth hound were essentially the same, though the Bloodhound was slightly bigger, with more variation in coat colour.<sup id=""cite_ref-Ash_21-0""> </sup> [button link=""http://alphamatch.com/listing-type/pets/?pet-type=1081&amp;breed-2=3835"" color=""black"" type=""big-button"" type=""Search for Bloodhound""]Search for Bloodhound[/button] &nbsp; <h3>Origin issues</h3> Throughout most of its history the bloodhound was seen as a dog of English or Anglo-Scottish origin, either of unknown ancestry, <sup id=""cite_ref-Caius_19-1""></sup> or, more recently, as developed in part from the St Hubert. It was only in the 19th century that it was claimed, primarily by Le Couteulx, to be the St Hubert itself. Medieval hunting pictures show raches and limers, of the general sagax type, with hanging ears and lips, but not having the specific characteristics of the bloodhound. 16th century descriptions of the St Hubert as short-legged, and only medium sized <sup id=""cite_ref-Charles_4-1""></sup>have led to speculation that the main European antecedent of the bloodhound was rather the Norman hound, which was very large, than the St Hubert. Others such as the sleuth-hound, the Talbot, the dun-hound and the southern hound, as well as pack hounds, have also been supposed to have contributed to its make-up. Some writers doubt whether anything certain can be said about specific breed ancestry beyond the last few centuries. The picture given by Le Couteulx and D?Yauville of the St Hubert was that it changed considerably through mixed breeding, and perhaps degenerated, before its disappearance, while the bloodhound which replaced it, preserved its original character. However, it is apparent from 16th century pictures that the bloodhound itself has changed considerably. The modern St Hubert is the English bloodhound, in descent and type. Generally, national and regional variants of hounds, terriers, spaniels etc. have been recognised as separate breeds, France in particular having many regional breeds of hound; the bloodhound?s identification as the St Hubert makes it an anomaly in this respect. Whether the bloodhound is British or Belgian in origin is ultimately not something one can prove historically, depending as it does on whether one chooses to regard two related animals differing in tradition, and history, and somewhat in type, as separate breeds, or variants of the same one. <h3>Breed standards</h3> Descriptions of the desirable physical qualities of a hunting hound go back to Medieval books on hunting. All dogs used in the hunting field were 'gentle', that is of good breeding (not necessarily pure breeding), and parents were carefully chosen to maintain and improve conformation. In 1896, making some use of wording found in earlier descriptions, Edwin Brough and Dr J Sidney Turner published <i>Points and Characteristics of the Bloodhound or Sleuth-Hound</i>. This was adopted by the newly formed Association of Bloodhound Breeders, and ultimately became, with very little change, the 'official' breed standard of the KC and the AKC. Meanwhile, the Belgian or Dutch Comte Henri de Bylandt, or H A graaf van Bylandt, published <i>Races des Chiens</i> in 1897, a huge and very important illustrated compilation of breed descriptions, or standards. In this French edition the Bloodhound appears as the Chien de St Hubert, although the pictures illustrating the standard are all of British Bloodhounds, many of them those of Edwin Brough. The book was revised and reprinted in four languages in 1904, and in this edition the English text of the standard is that of the Association of Bloodhound Breeders, while the French text is closely based on it. However, the present FCI standard uses a quite different layout and wording. The AKC standard has hardly been altered from the original of 1896, the principal change being that the colours, 'black and tan', 'red and tan', and 'tawny', have been renamed as 'black and tan', 'liver and tan', and 'red', but the British KChas made considerable changes. Some of these were simply matters of presentation and did not affect content. However, responding to the view that the requirements of some breed standards were potentially detrimental to the health or well-being of the animal, changes have been made affecting the required eye-shape and the loose skin, the most recent revision being 2008-9. <h3>Derivation of name</h3> The word 'bloodhound' is recorded from c1330. Most recent accounts say that its etymological meaning is ?hound of pure or noble blood?. This derives from an original suggestion of Le Couteulx de Canteleu in the nineteenth century, which has been enthusiastically and uncritically espoused by later writers, perhaps because it absolved this undoubtedly good-natured dog from suggestions of bloodthirstiness. Neither Le Couteulx nor anyone since has offered any historical evidence to support this view. The suggestion sometimes seen that the word derives from 'blooded hound' is without basis, as the expression does not appear in early English, and 'blooded' in this meaning is not found before the late eighteenth century. Before then 'bloodhound' had been taken to mean, 'hound for blood', or ?blood-seeking hound?. This was the explanation put forward by John Caius, who was one of the most learned men of his time, and had an interest in etymology, in the sixteenth century. It is supported by considerable historical linguistic evidence, which can be gleaned from such sources as the <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> (<i>OED</i>): the fact that first uses of the word ?blood? to refer to good breeding in an animal post date the first use of ?bloodhound?; that other comparable uses, as in ?blood-horse? and ?blood-stock? appear many centuries later; and that derogatory uses of the word ?bloodhound?, which any suggestion of noble breeding would sadly weaken, appear from as early as c1400. Other early sources tell us that hounds were supposed to have an interest in blood, and that the bloodhound was used to follow the trail of a wounded animal. In the absence of anything in early usage, or any historical evidence whatsoever, to support the modern explanation, the older must be regarded as correct. In the 2012 on-line edition of the <i>OED </i>the entry for 'bloodhound' has been brought up to date, for the first time pronouncing specifically on the etymological meaning. Clearly the editors have found no historical plausibility in the idea that the name refers to good breeding, which they do not even mention. <h2></h2> <h2>Working the Bloodhound</h2> <h3>Scenting ability</h3> The Bloodhound's physical characteristics account for its ability to follow a scent trail left several days in the past. Under optimal conditions, a Bloodhound can detect as few as one or two cells. The Bloodhound's nasal chambers (where scents are identified) are larger than those of most other breeds. The number of olfactory receptor cells are 4 billion in a bloodhound, compared to just 5 million in a human and 100 million in a rabbit.The surface area of bloodhound olfactory epithelium is 59 sq.in. compared to human's 1.55 sq.in. (10 sq.cm.) The large, long pendent ears serve to prevent wind from scattering nearby skin cells while the dog's nose is on the ground; the folds of wrinkled flesh under the lips and neck?called the shawl?serve to catch stray scent particles in the air or on a nearby branch as the Bloodhound is scenting, reinforcing the scent in the dog's memory and nose. However, not all agree that the long ears and loose skin are functional, some regarding them as a handicap.<sup id=""cite_ref-Whitney_26-4""> </sup> <h3>Human Trailing</h3> There are many accounts of bloodhounds successfully following trails many hours, and even several days, old, the record being of a family found dead in Oregon, in 1954, over 330 hours after they had gone missing. The bloodhound is generally used to follow the individual scent of a fugitive or lost person, taking the scent from a ?scent article? ? something the quarry is known to have touched, which could be an item of clothing, a car seat, an identified footprint etc. Many bloodhounds will follow the drift of scent a good distance away from the actual footsteps of the quarry, which can enable them to cut corners and reach the end of the trail more quickly. In America, sticking close to the footsteps is called ?tracking?, while the freer method is known as ?trailing? (in the UK, ?hunting?), and is held to reflect the bloodhound?s concentration on the individual human scent, rather than that of, say, vegetation crushed by the feet of the quarry. <sup id=""cite_ref-Textbook_45-1""></sup>Having lost a scent, a good bloodhound will stubbornly cast about for long periods, if necessary, in order to recover it. The bloodhound is handled on a tracking harness, which has a metal ring above the shoulders, to which a leash is attached, so that the hound?s neck is not jerked up when the leash becomes taut, as it would with a collar. The leash is at least long enough to allow the hound to cross freely in front of the handler, some handlers preferring quite a short leash, giving better communication with the hound, others liking something longer, maybe twenty or thirty feet.<sup id=""cite_ref-Textbook_45-2""> </sup> <h3>Training</h3> It is generally agreed that the basis of initial training is to make the experience enjoyable for the puppy or young hound, to keep its enthusiasm high.Whitney preferred waiting till the hound is 18 months old, to start training, but others start as young as possible, say three months. Training can be started by running short trails on a family member whom the puppy sees walk away, at first remaining visible, and later going out of sight. Even though familiar with the scent of the ?runner?, it can be given a scent-article to sniff, and given the command to follow. It can also be introduced to the tracking harness, which is put on just before the trail starts, and removed as soon as it is finished. On reaching the runner the puppy is given lavish praise and perhaps a reward. Generally in training the handler must know exactly where the runner went, so that he does not encourage the hound when it is wrong, or ?correct? it when it is on the scent, but he should not be too ready with his corrections if the hound goes astray, or it may come to rely on him. He should give the hound time to realise its mistake and put itself right, if possible. As training progresses the handler learns to ?read? his hound?s behaviour. The hound must trust its nose and the handler must trust the hound. From early hot trails on a familiar person, the young hound progresses to colder trails on the scents of strangers. Later training can be designed to teach particular lessons: crossing trails with false scents, having the runner start out with a companion, who leaves him somewhere along the trail, laying a trail on ground frequented by wild animals. This will teach the hound not to change on to other humans, or riot on animal scents (known as ?staying clean? [US], or ?freedom from change? [UK]). It also needs to work over a variety of ground and learn to cope with distractions of many kinds, as well as being introduced to 'negative trails': given a scent article which has <b>not</b> been handled by anyone in the area, so that it will learn to indicate to a handler that the required scent is not there. If it is becoming discouraged it can revert to simpler tasks to recover enthusiasm. <h3>Identification</h3> Canine identification of a suspect can help police with their inquiries, and evidence of identification is accepted in some courts. The most approved method of identification is for the hound to jump up, and place its paws on the subject?s chest. In the case of a lost person or a known fugitive identification will not be significant, and in the case of a potentially violent, possibly armed, fugitive a bloodhound handler will not want his dog to approach the quarry for fear of injury to the bloodhound. Many bloodhounds reaching the end of a trail will show no interest in the person they have been trailing, and are difficult to train to identify. Leon Whitney recommended a method of initial training in which identification was the first thing learned, based on giving the young hound a scent-article from someone who walks a very short distance out of sight into a barn, where he stands with a piece of liver, while another person, also smelling of liver, stands nearby. The hound is led along the 'trail', and if it shows an inclination to go to the wrong person it is chastised, but gets the liver if it goes to the right one. When the hound goes to the right person almost infallibly, the number of people is increased, making the choice more difficult, and eventually the brief walks are extended into full trails.<sup id=""cite_ref-Whitney_26-10""> </sup> <h3>Voice</h3> A common misconception is that Bloodhounds are employed in packs; while this is sometimes the case in Britain, in North America, Bloodhounds are used as solitary trackers. When they are on a trail, they are usually silent and do not give voice as other scenthounds. The original use of the Bloodhound as a leash-hound, to find but not disturb animals, would require silent trailing.<sup id=""cite_ref-Turbervile_16-3""> </sup> Nevertheless, the Bloodhound bay is among the most impressive of hound voices. When hunting in a pack they are expected to be in full cry. They are more likely to 'give tongue,' 'throw their tongue,' or 'speak' when hunting in a pack than when hunting singly, and more when hunting free than when on the leash. The quality of 'speaking to the line', that is giving tongue when on the correct scent while remaining silent when off it, is valued in British Bloodhound circles, on aesthetic grounds and because it makes it very easy to 'read' the hound's tracking behaviour. As a result special trophies for speaking to the correct line are on offer at British working trials (where hounds hunt singly), although rarely awarded.<sup id=""cite_ref-Lowe_10-7""> </sup> [button link=""http://alphamatch.com/listing-type/pets/?pet-type=1081&amp;breed-2=3835"" color=""black"" type=""big-button"" type=""Search for Bloodhound""]Search for Bloodhound[/button]",NULL,NULL,NULL,"Y","0"

The Lacy was first recognized in 2001 by the Texas Senate. In Senate Resolution No. 436, the 77th Legislature honored the Lacy as ""a true Texas breed"". In June 2005, Governor Rick Perry signed the legislation adopting the blue Lacy as ""the official State Dog Breed of Texas"". As expected, the vast majority of Lacy dogs are found in Texas. However, as the breed becomes more well recognized, there are breeding populations being established across the United States, and in Canada.

Height at the withers is from 17 to 22 inches (43 to 56 cm). Dependent on height and general conditioning, weight should be approximately 25 to 45 pounds (11 to 20 kg) for females and 35 to 55 pounds (16 to 25 kg) for males. The standards listed in the Texas House Concurrent Resolution No. 108 are slightly different: height between 18 to 25 inches (46 to 64 cm), weight between 30 to 50 pounds (14 to 23 kg) but it was not until 2005 that it was official.<sup id=""cite_ref-state_2-2""> </sup> <h3>Color</h3> Though they are often called ""blue"" Lacys, there are three permissible color varieties of the Lacy. ""Blues"" are any shade of gray from light silver to dark charcoal. ""Reds"" range from light cream to rust. The ""Tri"" combines a blue base with distinct red markings as appropriate for trim, and white which may appear on the brisket and stretch from chin to groin. White may also be present on one or more paws. Excessive white is discouraged, and markings on the face or above mid-line are a disqualifying fault. Their eyes are sharp and alert, ranging in color from bright yellow to rich amber.<sup id=""cite_ref-standard_1-2""> </sup> <h3>Coat</h3> The coat should be short, smooth and tight. An excessively long or rough coat is a disqualification. Lacys shed, but require minimal grooming. <h3>Temperament</h3> Lacys are intelligent, intense, active, and alert. Developed to be both hunting and herding dogs, they display great drive and determination to work with big game and control difficult livestock. Young dogs may have too much energy and drive for small children. They are easy to train, learning new skills quickly. <h2>Activities</h2> The Lacy is a working breed, and does much better when given a job, which allows them to burn off excessive energy. Work they excel at includes herding livestock, blood trailing or tracking, treeing game, running trap lines, and hunting wild hogs. Modern activities like agility that stress intelligence, passion, speed and nimbleness may be appropriate substitutes for traditional work. Herding instincts and trainability can be measured at noncompetitive herding tests. Lacys generally exhibit herding instincts, and can be trained to compete in stock dog trials, or hog bays. During recent years, Lacy dogs have also become recognized for their great tracking skills, and sought after to be used to locate ""lost"" game animals. <h2>Health</h2> Lacys are generally very healthy dogs. Developed for generations to meet the requirements of ranchers and hunters, they are sturdy enough to withstand tough terrain, difficult working conditions, and both hot and cold weather. However, skin problems and food allergies can occur. Color dilution alopecia is very rare but has occurred in Lacys.<sup id=""cite_ref-health_9-0""> </sup> <h2>History</h2> The Lacy dog was named after the Lacy brothers (Frank, George, Ewin, and Harry Lacy) who moved from Kentucky to Texas in 1858, settling in Burnet County, Texas. The dog, according to the Lacy family, was a mixture of English Shepherd (or perhaps coyote),greyhound, and wolf. Texas House Concurrent Resolution No. 108 also mentions scenthound. The brothers originally developed the dogs' natural herding instincts to work the family's free-roaming hogs.<sup id=""cite_ref-hogdogs_11-0""> </sup> On March 15, 2005, in the 79th Legislature of the State of Texas, Representative Joaquin Castro and members of the Texas Lacy Game Dog Association filed House Concurrent Resolution No. 108, proposing the blue Lacy as state dog of Texas. This legislation was proposed to recognize the original breeders and their contribution to the State of Texas as well as to honor the Lacy as a Texas original. House Concurrent Resolution No. 108 was adopted by the Texas House of Representatives on May 15, 2005, and by the Senate ten days later on May 25, 2005. Governor Rick Perry signed the legislation adopting the Lacy as ""the official State Dog Breed of Texas"" on June 18, 2005.<sup id=""cite_ref-state_2-5""> </sup> The Lacy was proposed by some in 2008 to replace Reveille VII, a collie, as the mascot dog of Texas A&amp;M. In accordance with tradition since Reveille III, however, a collie was chosen.

The head is carried well up and the tail carried over the back, without signs of fear or nervousness. The Bluetick coat should be moderately coarse and glossy. The Bluetick Coonhound gets its ""blue"" coloring from black/white mottling which gives the impression of a navy blue color. This mottling covers the body and can be interspersed with variously-shaped black spots on the back, ears and sides. Preference runs to more blue than black on the body. Black should predominate on the head and ears. Bluetick Coonhounds should have tan dots over the eyes and on the cheeks will be dark red. All coonhounds should be 1 foot 11 inches -2 feet and weigh approximately 55 to 80 pounds. Females are considerably smaller. Feet should be cat-like, rounded with well-arched toes. Their paws are larger than nearly all other breeds of dogs. Rear legs should have a moderate bend at the hocks. All legs should be straight when viewed from the front or rear. Gascon blues are larger than standard blueticks, with males a minimum of 27 inches and a maximum of 30 inches. See the American Blue Gascon Coonhound Association's breed standard: http://www.abgha.org/standard.htm <h3>Temperament</h3> Bluetick Coonhounds are bred to be hunting dogs. They are athletic and hardy and need a full-time job or activity such as hunting, obedience or agility to stay happy. They can be challenging to train and they should be monitored around cats or other small animals. They are, like their hound counterparts, very intelligent breeds, with an uncanny knack for problem-solving. Once trained, the breed is very mindful of its owner. Something first time owners should be aware of is the daunting task of ""voice-training"" these dogs. They tend to be relentlessly loud barkers and/or howlers. If properly socialized from a young age, they can make a great family pet. These dogs were bred to be working/hunting dogs. In normal conditions, this dog is excellent around children. They are mindful, friendly dogs. However, their noses will keep them in trouble, so food and garbage should never be left out unattended. Often mistaken for aggressiveness, the breed will ""greet"" strangers with its signature howl and will sniff the subject until satisfied. Usually this is just the way the breed gets to know its subjects. Since Blueticks are driven by their strong sense of smell, they make excellent hunting/tracking dogs. If allowed, they will tree almost any animal smaller than them. Blueticks are generally easier to handle in the field than some other coon hounds. <h2>History</h2> The Bluetick Coonhound, which originated in Louisiana, was developed from the Bleu de Gascogne hound of southwest France, as well as the English Foxhound, the cur dog, theAmerican Foxhound, and the Black And Tan Virginia Foxhound. Originally, Bluetick Coonhounds were registered in the United Kennel Club under the English Foxhound and Coonhound, but were recognized by the club as a separate breed in 1946. Bluetick Coonhounds are also recognized by the Australian National Kennel Council and the New Zealand Kennel Club. In April 2009 the breed was accepted by the American Kennel Club and in December 2009 they became eligible to compete in AKC coonhound events. The American Blue Gascon is a subgroup of bluetick coonhounds that is larger, heavier, and more ""houndy"" looking than the standard bluetick. American Blue Gascons are often referred to as ""old-fashioned"" blueticks. This is due to their appearance and ""colder"" nose, or slower style of tracking, compared to other modern coonhound breeds. The picture here appears to be of a female American Blue Gascon. <h2>Famous Bluetick Coonhounds</h2> Smokey, the mascot of the University of Tennessee, is a Bluetick. A Bluetick Coonhound named Tet was the companion of Stringfellow Hawke, the main character of the popular 1980s television show Airwolf. An unnamed Bluetick Coonhound is featured in Blake Shelton's hit single, ""Ol' Red"". The song relates an escape plan of a man convicted of a crime of passion when he murdered his wife and her lover. He devises a plan to have a female Bluetick lure the prison's male Redbone Coonhound Ol' Red away from the narrator (Shelton) instead of tracking him as he heads in the opposite direction. The closing lines of the song are: ""Now there's red-haired Blueticks all in the South, / Love got me in there and love got me out."" Coonhounds are featured in the book Where the Red Fern Grows. However, the two main dogs are Redbone Coonhounds. Neil Young has stated that his song ""Old King"" is a tribute to a deceased Bluetick Coonhound he once owned. Emmylou Harris sings about her friend Lillian's ""Bluetick hound dog, Gideon"" in her song Red Dirt Girl. Dolly Parton sings about an old woman who lives ""with a one-eyed cat named Wink, a billy goat, and a bluetick hound"" in her song ""These Old Bones."" Charlie Daniels mentions that he is ""kinda like my old Bluetick hound/I like to lay around in the shade"" in his song ""Long Haired Country Boy."" Old Blue, a Bluetick Coonhound, was in the 1960 Elia Kazan film, ""Wild River"". Ken Kesey, in his novel, ""One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest"", used a Bluetick Coonhound as a symbol for his main character Chief Bromden. In Savage Sam, the sequel to Old Yeller, the title character is a Bluetick Coonhound. He is meant to be the son of Old Yeller, despite Old Yeller having been a Black Mouth Cur. In Chappelle's Show the dog in the opening credits is a Bluetick Coonhound. In the book Summer of the Monkeys by Wilson Rawls, the hound dog Rowdy is a Bluetick Coonhound.

These dogs were often a first line of defense against predators such as lions, hyenas and other big cats and were valuable in tracking and holding down wounded game. Old farmers tell many tales of the strength, agility, and courage of their Boerboels.

Boerboel, therefore, translates as either ""farmer's dog"" or ""Boer's dog"". The Boerboel is the only South African dog breed created to defend the homestead. Despite the Boerboel's long breeding history, there is great uncertainty as to how many and which breeds were used to create it. It is generally believed that the breed was created from interbreeding native African canine species with breeds brought into South Africa from Dutch, French, and British settlers. The most likely origins are claimed to date back to Jan van Riebeeck?s arrival to the Cape in 1652. Van Riebeeck brought a ""Bullenbijter"" with him. Those with him, and later European settlers, also had large, strong dogs, that almost certainly bred with the indigenous, domestic dog breeds of South Africa.<sup id=""cite_ref-UKBC_-_Breed_Description_2-0""> </sup><sup id=""cite_ref-sabt.co.za_-_Know_the_Boerboel_3-0""></sup> Later, in 1928, the diamond mining company De Beers imported Bullmastiffs to South Africa to guard the mines. This breed was also crossbred with Boerboels in the region.<sup id=""cite_ref-sabt.co.za_1-1""> </sup> <h3>Boerboels today</h3> The Boerboel Breeders Association was established in 1983 in the Senekal district of the Free State with the sole objective of ennobling and promoting the Boerboel as a unique South African dog breed. Today, Boerboel breeding is both a hobby and an industry in South Africa. These dogs are now exported from South Africa to other parts of the world. The protective character of the Boerboel is still evident and is much sought after, as is the calm, stable, and confident composure of the breed. The dogs are obedient and intelligent and have strong territorial instincts. The Boerboel remains the guarding breed of choice amongst current day farmers and is very popular for the same reason in urban communities.<sup id=""cite_ref-Boerboel_International_Breed_Standard_4-0""> </sup> The name boerboel is commonly misspelled as <i>boerbul</i>, <i>boerbull</i>, and <i>borbull</i>.<sup id=""cite_ref-South_Africa_Boerboel_Directory_.26_Breeders_5-0""> </sup> In 2010, the Boerboel was banned in Denmark for being a fighting dog.<sup id=""cite_ref-6""> </sup> <h2>Description</h2> <h3>Appearance</h3> <h3>Coat</h3> The Boerboel is an average shedder and easy to groom. The occasional brushing and a monthly bath and nail trim is all that is needed. The breed has an outer coat that is normally coarse and straight, and an undercoat that is soft and dense.<sup id=""cite_ref-Dog-Names.org.uk_Boerboel_7-0""> </sup> Its coat is short, dense, smooth, soft, and shiny. Their coat color can be various shades of red, brown, or fawn. Many dogs have a black mask around their mouth that sometimes extends to their eyes and ears. The Breed Standard colors for the Boerboel is Fawn, Light Fawn, Red all colors of red and Brindle <h3>Temperament</h3> Boerboels are an intelligent and energetic breed.

However, Boerboels can suffer from hip or elbow dysplasia, vaginal hyperplasia, <sup id=""cite_ref-sabt.co.za_-_VHE_10-0""></sup>ectropion, and entropion. Recently, juvenile epilepsy (with attacks brought on by metabolic changes or stress) has appeared in the boerboel breed. The average life expectancy is ten years.<sup id=""cite_ref-boerboels.co.uk_12-0""> </sup> <h2>Requirements</h2> Prospective owners must recognize that owning a boerboel requires a significant commitment in time and energy as they need to be trained and properly socialized in order to be happy, well-adjusted family members.<sup id=""cite_ref-UKBC_-_Breed_Description_2-2""> </sup><sup id=""cite_ref-sabt.co.za_-_Buying_a_Boerboel_8-2""></sup> These dogs thrive under positive reinforcement training techniques and require human companionship and structure. If left isolated, Boerboels will digress and may become destructive. Owners should be wary of trying to forcefully control the dog as it is detrimental to their psychological health and could cause potential behavioral backlash in the future. These dogs benefit from an owner who respects their size and strength but is not fearful of it. If you are considering adding a boerboel to your family or already own a boerboel and are thinking of moving (to a smaller home), remember this ? bored boerboels are destructive boerboels and at 150 lbs, can do a lot of damage. Although more suitable for large yards, Boerboels are adaptable and can live in small environments as long as they receive regular exercise and a lot of attention. Whatever the amount of space available, they need to have plenty of physical and mental exercise. The Boerboel can be exercised in a large, securely enclosed yard, but at a minimum this type of dog needs to be taken on a long walk every day. According to the vast majority of Boerboel breeders, this dog should only be off leash when on its property.<sup> </sup> [button link=""http://alphamatch.com/listing-type/pets/?pet-type=1081&amp;breed-2=1387"" color=""black"" type=""big-button"" type=""Search for Boerboel""]Search for Boerboel[/button]",NULL,NULL,NULL,"Y","0"

The hair's texture is woolly, as opposed to silky, and is never trimmed or clipped unless kept as pets. The hair sheds very little, but requires regular combing to prevent matting. The Bolognese often appears on lists of dogs that allegedly do not shed (moult). It is true that these dogs do not seasonally moult or lose large amounts of fur as many other breeds do. However, they do eventually lose and replace individual hairs, similar to human hair growth cycles. Each hair in their coat grows from a hair follicle, which grows, dies and is then replaced by another follicle. When the follicle dies, the hair is shed. The length of time of the growing and shedding cycle varies by age and other factors. There is no such thing as a completely non-shedding breed.<sup id=""cite_ref-4""> </sup> [button link=""http://alphamatch.com/listing-type/pets/?pet-type=1081&amp;breed-2=1365"" color=""brown"" type=""big-button"" type=""Search for Bolognese""]Search for Bolognese[/button]",NULL,NULL,NULL,"Y","0"

It was specifically bred for intelligence and obedience. Ranked number one in Stanley Coren's <i>The Intelligence of Dogs</i> and typically extremely energetic, acrobatic, smart and athletic, they frequently compete with great success in dog sports, in addition to their success in sheepdog trials and are often cited as the most intelligent of all dogs. In January 2011, a Border Collie was reported to have learned 1,022 words and acts consequently to human citation of those words.<sup id=""cite_ref-2""> </sup><sup id=""cite_ref-3""></sup> [button link=""http://alphamatch.com/listing-type/pets/?pet-type=1081&amp;breed-2=1839"" color=""black""]Search for Border Collie[/button] &nbsp; <h2>History</h2> The Border Collie is descended from landrace collies, a type found widely in the British Isles. The name for the breed came from its probable place of origin along the Anglo-Scottish border. Mention of the ""Collie"" or ""Colley"" type first appeared toward the end of the 19th century, although the word ""collie"" is older than this and has its origin in the Scots language. It is also thought that the word 'collie' comes from the old Celtic word for useful. Many of the best Border Collies today can be traced back to a dog known as Old Hemp.<sup id=""cite_ref-5""> </sup> In 1915, James Reid, Secretary of the International Sheep Dog Society (ISDS) in the United Kingdom first used the term ""Border Collie"" to distinguish those dogs registered by the ISDS from the Kennel Club's Collie (or Scotch Collie, including the Rough Collie and Smooth Collie) which originally came from the same working stock but had developed a different, standardised appearance following introduction to the show ring in 1860 and mixture with different types breeds.<sup id=""cite_ref-6""> </sup> &nbsp; <h2>Description</h2> <h3>Appearance</h3> In general, Border Collies are medium-sized dogs with a moderate amount of coat, which is often thick and frequently sheds. Their double coats vary from smooth to rough, and come in many colours, although black and white is the most common. Black tricolour (black/tan/white or sable and white), red, white, and red tricolour (red/tan/white) have also been seen regularly, with other colours such as blue, lilac, red merle, blue merle, brindle, and ""Australian red/gold"" seen less frequently. Some Border Collies may also have single-colour coats.<sup id=""cite_ref-American_Kennel_Club_4-1""> </sup> Eye colour varies from brown to blue, and occasionally eyes of differing colour occur; this is usually seen with merles. The ears of the Border Collie are also variable ? some have fully erect ears, some fully dropped ears, and others semi-erect ears (similar to those of the rough Collie or sighthounds). Although working Border Collie handlers sometimes have superstitions about the appearance of their dogs (handlers may avoid mostly white dogs due to the unfounded idea that sheep will not respect a white or almost all white dog), in general a dog's appearance is considered by the American Border Collie Association to be irrelevant. It is considered much more useful to identify a working Border Collie by its attitude and ability than by its looks. Dogs bred for showing are more homogeneous in appearance than working Border Collies, since to win in conformation showing they must conform closely to breed club standards that are specific on many points of the structure, coat, and colour. Kennel clubs specify, for example, that the Border Collie must have a ""keen and intelligent"" expression, and that the preferred eye colour is dark brown. In deference to the dog's working origin, scars and broken teeth received in the line of duty are not to be counted against a Border Collie in the show ring. The males' height from withers comes from 19 to 22 inches, females from 18 to 21. <h3>Temperament</h3> Border Collies require considerable daily physical exercise and mental stimulation. The Border Collie is an intelligent dog breed; in fact, it is widely considered to be the most intelligent dog breed. Although the primary role of the Border Collie is being a livestock herding dog, this type of breed is becoming increasingly popular as pets. Due to their working heritage, Border Collies are very demanding, playful, and energetic that they are better off in households that can provide them with plenty of play and exercise with humans or other dogs. Due to their demanding personalities and need for mental stimulation and exercise, many Border Collies develop neurotic behaviors in households that are not able to provide for their needs. They are infamous for chewing holes in walls, destructive biting and chewing on furniture such as chairs and table legs, and digging holes out of boredom. One of the prime reasons for getting rid of a Border Collie is their unsuitability for families with small children, cats, and other dogs, due to their intense desire to herd and be the alpha; this was bred into them for hundreds of years and still one of their chief uses outside the household. However, they may will still live happily with other pets if they are used to them. Though they are a common choice for household pets, Border Collies have attributes that make them less suited for those who cannot give them the exercise they need. As with many working breeds, Border Collies can be motion-sensitive and they may chase moving vehicles.<sup id=""cite_ref-yourpurebredpuppy.com_19-0""> </sup> <h2>Health</h2> <h3>Life span</h3> The natural life span of the Border Collie is between 10 to 17 years, with an average lifespan of 12 years. The median longevities of breeds of similar size are usually 12 to 13 years.<sup id=""cite_ref-Cassidee_Weight_21-0""> </sup> Leading causes of death are cancer (23.6%), old age (17.9%) and cerebral vascular afflictions (9.4%).<sup id=""cite_ref-KCSurvey_20-1""> </sup> <h3>Common health problems</h3> Hip dysplasia, Collie eye anomaly (CEA), and epilepsy are considered the primary genetic diseases of concern in the breed at this time.<sup id=""cite_ref-22"">[22]</sup>CEA is a congenital, inherited eye disease involving the retina, choroid, and sclera that sometimes affects Border Collies. In Border Collies, it is generally a mild disease and rarely significantly impairs vision. There is now a DNA test available for CEA and, through its use, breeders can ensure that they will not produce affected pups. There are different types of hip testing available including OFA (Orthopedic Foundation for Animals) and PennHip. Radiographs are taken and sent to these organizations to determine a dog's hip and elbow quality. Two types of hearing loss occur in the breed. The first type is pigment associated and is found in Border Collie puppies. The second type is known as adult onset hearing loss. These dogs have a normal auditory brainstem response test as pups but gradually lose their hearing some time between one and eight years of age. A study is currently underway at The Translational Genomics Research Institute to identify the genetic cause of adult onset hearing loss in the breed. Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL) is a rare but serious disease that is limited to show Border Collies. NCL results in severe neurological impairment and early death; afflicted dogs rarely survive beyond two years of age. The mutation causing the form of the disease found in Border Collies was identified by Scott Melville in the laboratory of Dr. Alan Wilton of the School of Biotechnology and Biomolecular Sciences,University of New South Wales. There is no treatment or cure, but a DNA test is now available to detect carriers as well as affected dogs. Trapped Neutrophil Syndrome (TNS) is a hereditary disease in which the bone marrow produces neutrophils (white cells) but is unable to effectively release them into the bloodstream. Affected puppies have an impaired immune system and will eventually die from infections they cannot fight. The mutation responsible for TNS has been found in Border Collies in English working dogs, in show dogs that had originated in Australia and New Zealand, and in unrelated Australian working dogs. This indicates that the gene is widespread and probably as old as the breed itself. TNS was identified by Jeremy Shearman in the laboratory of Dr. Alan Wilton of the School of Biotechnology and Biomolecular Sciences, University of New South Wales. There is no cure, but a DNA test is now available to detect carriers as well as affected dogs.<sup id=""cite_ref-25"">[25]</sup><sup id=""cite_ref-26"">[26]</sup> Other diseases found less commonly include glaucoma, juvenile cataracts, osteochondritis, hypothyroidism and diabetes mellitus. A syndrome of exercise induced collapse similar to that seen in Labrador Retrievers (otherwise termed Border Collie Collapse)and triggered by episodes of collapse associated with periods of intense exercise has been described in Border Collies in North America, Europe and Australia; and is currently the subject of further investigation.<sup id=""cite_ref-27""> </sup> Elbow dysplasia may also occur in the breed. Dogs homozygous for the merle gene, sometimes referred to as ""double merles"", are likely to have ocular and/or auditory defects.

The International Sheep Dog Society encourages breeding for herding ability, whereas the Kennel Club (UK)encourages breeding for a standardised appearance. The ISDS registry is by far the older of the two, and ISDS dogs are eligible for registration as pedigree Border Collies with the Kennel Club (KC) ? but not vice versa. The only way for a Border Collie without an ISDS pedigree to be added to the ISDS registry is by proving its worth as a herding dog so that it can be Registered on Merit (ROM). <h3>United States</h3> One of the principal registries for Border Collies in the United States is the American Border Collie Association (ABCA), which is dedicated to the preservation of the traditional working dog. The breed was also recognised in 1994 by the American Kennel Club (AKC) after occupying the AKC's Miscellaneous Class for over 50 years. The recognition was under protest from the majority of Border Collie affiliated groups, such as the United States Border Collie Club, which felt that emphasis on the breed's working skills would be lost under AKC recognition. AKC registrations have gradually increased since recognition and by the year 2004 there were 1,984 new AKC registrations of Border Collies, with a further 2,378 for the year 2005. By contrast, the American Border Collie Association registers approximately 20,000 Border Collies annually. Because of the inherent tension between the goals of breeding to a working standard and to an appearance standard, the American Border Collie Association voted in 2003 that dogs who attained a conformation championship would be delisted from the ABCA registry, regardless of ability. Cross-registration is allowed between the working registries, and AKC accepts dogs registered with ABCA and NASDS; but none of the working registries in the U.S. honor AKC pedigrees. <h3>Australia</h3> In Australia, Border Collies are registered with an Australian National Kennel Council (ANKC) affiliated state control body or with a working dog registry. Between 2,011 and 2,701 ANKC pedigreed Border Collies have been registered with the ANKC each year since 1986. Inclusion on the ANKC affiliate's main register allows Border Collies to compete in conformation, obedience, agility, tracking, herding and other ANKC-sanctioned events held by an ANKC affiliated club, while inclusion on the limited register prohibits entry in conformation events. The ANKC provides a breed standard; however, this applies to conformation events only and has no influence on dogs entering in performance events. Non-ANKC pedigreed dogs may also be eligible for inclusion on an ANKC associate or sporting register and be able to compete in ANKC performance or herding events. Agility organisations such as the Agility Dog Association of Australia (ADAA) have their own registry which allows the inclusion of any dog wishing to compete in their events. <h3>Canada</h3> In Canada, Agriculture Canada has recognised the Canadian Border Collie Association as the registry under the Animal Pedigree Act for any Border Collie that is designated as ""Pure Breed"" in Canada. The criteria used are based on herding lineage rather than appearance. It is a two-tiered registry in that dogs imported that are registered with a foreign Kennel Club that does hold conformation shows are given a ""B"" registration, whereas those that come directly from other working registries are placed on the ""A"" registry. Recently, the Canadian Kennel Club has polled its members to decide if Border Collies should be included on the CKC ""Miscellaneous List"". This designation would allow Border Collie owners the ability to compete in all CKC events, but the CKC would not be the registering body. People who compete in performance events support the move. The CBCA is against this designation. <h3>South Africa</h3> The registration of working sheepdogs in South Africa is the responsibility of the South African Sheepdog Association. ISDS registered dogs imported into the country can be transferred onto the SASDA register. Dogs not registered can become eligible for registration by being awarded a certificate of working ability by a registered judge. Occasionally they will facilitate the testing of dogs used for breeding, for Hip dysplasia and Collie eye anomaly, to encourage the breeding of dogs without these genetic flaws. <h3>Turkey</h3> The registration of working Border Collies in Turkey is the province of the Border Collie Dernegi (Turkish Border Collie Association) established in 2007. The president of the association is Dr. Haldun Mergen. The BCD/TBCA is an affiliate of ISDS, and will apply for associate ISDS membership in 2009. <h3>Elsewhere</h3> The Border Collie breed is also recognised as the prime sheep dog by the International Stock Dog Federation (ISDF), based in Piccadilly, London, UK. <h2>Activities</h2> Border Collies are one of the most popular breeds for dog agility competitions. They also excel at competitive obedience, showmanship, flyball, tracking, and USBCHA Sheepdog trials and herding events.<sup id=""cite_ref-Hartnagle-Taylor_and_Ty_Taylor_41-0""> </sup> [button link=""http://alphamatch.com/listing-type/pets/?pet-type=1081&amp;breed-2=1839"" color=""black""]Search for Border Collie[/button]",NULL,NULL,NULL,"Y","0"

The border terrier was bred to have long enough legs to keep up with the horses and other foxhounds, which traveled with them, and small enough bodies to crawl in the burrows of foxes and chase them out so the hunters had a blank shot. The foxhounds that traveled with them were not small enough to do the Border terrier's job.

The V-shaped ears are on the sides of the head and fall towards the cheeks. Common coat colors are grizzle-and-tan, blue-and-tan, red, or wheaten. Whiskers are few and short. The tail is naturally moderately short, thick at the base and tapering.<sup id=""cite_ref-terrier1_4-1""> </sup> Narrow-bodied and well-proportioned, males stand 13 to 16 in (33 to 41 cm) at the shoulder, and weigh 13 to 15.5 lb (5.9 to 7.0 kg); females 11 to 14 in (28 to 36 cm) and 11.5 to 14 pounds (5.2 to 6.4 kg). They are very versatile in families and as family pets The Border Terrier has a double coat consisting of a short, dense, soft undercoat and harsh, wiry weather and dirt resistant, close-lying outer coat with no curl or wave. This coat usually requires hand-stripping twice a year to remove dead hair. It then takes about eight weeks for the top coat to come back in. For some dogs, weekly brushing will suffice. Most Border Terriers are seen groomed with short hair but longer hair can sometimes be preferred. <h3>Temperament</h3> Though sometimes stubborn and strong willed, border terriers are, on the whole very even tempered, and are friendly and rarely aggressive. They are very good with children, but may chase cats and any other small pets. Borders do well in task-oriented activities and have a surprising ability to jump high and run fast given the size of their legs. The breed has excelled in agility training, but they are quicker to learn jumps and see-saws than weaving poles. They take training for tasks very well, but appear less trainable if being taught mere tricks. The border in recent years has been bred to harbor a more subtle character so are more adaptable to apartment living if properly exercised. They are intelligent and eager to please, but they retain the capacity for independent thinking and initiative that were bred into them for working rats and fox underground. Their love of people and even temperament make them fine therapy dogs, especially for children and the elderly, and they are occasionally used to aid the blind or deaf. From a young age they should be trained on command. Borders can adapt to different environments and situations well, and are able to deal with temporary change well. They will get along well with cats that they have been raised with, but may chase other cats and small animals such as mice, birds, rabbits, squirrels, rats, and guinea pigs. Borders love to sit and watch what is going on. Walks with Borders will often involve them sitting and lying in the grass to observe the environment around them. <h2>Health</h2> Borders are a generally hardy breed, though there are certain genetic health problems associated with them, including: <ul> <li>Hip dysplasia</li> <li>Perthes disease</li> <li>Various heart defects</li> <li>Juvenile cataracts</li> <li>Progressive retinal atrophy</li> <li>Seizures</li> <li>Canine Epileptoid Cramping Syndrome (CECS)<sup id=""cite_ref-5""> </sup></li> </ul> A UK Kennel Club survey puts their median lifespan at 14 years.<sup id=""cite_ref-6""> </sup> Indigestion resulting from eating a toy can cause the appearance of illness. Typical symptoms include lethargy, unwillingness to play, a generally 'unhappy' appearance, lack of reaction to affection, and inability or unwillingness to sleep. These symptoms are generally very noticeable, however, they are also present just prior to Border Terrier bitches being on heat. <h2>Earthdog trials</h2> Border Terriers have earned more American Kennel Club (AKC) Earthdog titles than any other terrier. An AKC earthdog test is not true hunting, but an artificial, non-competitive, exercise in which terriers enter 9 in (23 cm) wide smooth wooden tunnels, buried under-ground, with one or more turns in order to bark or scratch at caged rats that are safely housed behind wooden bars. The tests are conducted to determine that instinctive traits are preserved and developed, as the breed originators intended for the dogs to their work. While earthdog tests are not a close approximation of hunting, they are popular in the U.S. and in some European countries because even over-large Kennel Club breeds can negotiate the tunnels with ease, dogs can come to no harm while working, and no digging is required. Since Border Terriers are ""essentially working terriers"", many Border Terrier owners consider it important to test and develop their dogs' instinct. These tests also provide great satisfaction for the dogs. The American Working Terrier Association (AWTA) does conduct ""trials""; where the dogs instincts are tested, and then judged to determine a ""Best of Breed"" Earthdog. These trials are also run similar as described below. <h2>History</h2> The Border Terrier originates in, and takes its name from the Scottish borders. Their original purpose was to bolt foxes which had gone to ground. They were also used to kill rodents, but they have been used to hunt otters and badgers too. The first Kennel Club Border Terrier ever registered was The Moss Trooper, a dog sired by Jacob Robson's Chip in 1912 and registered in the Kennel Club's Any Other Variety listing in 1913. The Border Terrier was rejected for formal Kennel Club recognition in 1914, but won its slot in 1920, with the first standard being written by Jacob Robson and John Dodd. Jasper Dodd was made first President of the Club. <h2>Famous Border Terriers</h2> <ul> <li>Bert, David Walliams &amp; Lara Stones dog</li> <li>Binka &amp; Nugget, Daniel Radcliffe's pet dogs.<sup id=""cite_ref-7""> </sup></li> <li>Indie in 64 Dalesman Drive</li> <li>Chomp in <i>102 Dalmatians</i></li> <li>Hercules in Toi et Moi (You and Me) - French film</li> <li>Hubble in <i>Good Boy!</i></li> <li>Xena (2013)</li> <li>Ivana <i>Pomeranian</i>,</li> <li>Lady Eccles in <i>Coronation Street</i> as Blanche Hunt's inheritance gift from her friend; belongs to her son-in-law Ken Barlow after her death in 2010</li> <li>Maggie, Andy Murray and Kim Sears' dog who has her own Twitter account with 16,000 followers as at March 2013.<sup id=""cite_ref-8""> </sup></li> <li>Monty and Rommel in <i>Monarch of the Glen</i></li> <li>Nancy in <i>Unfabulous</i> as Addie's pet dog</li> <li>Peanut as Baxter in <i>Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy</i> (mixed breed)</li> <li>Pepper as Pinkybones in <i>Another Happy Day</i></li> <li>Peter Weyland's dog in Prometheus (2012 film)</li> <li>Poppins, Mac's dog from <i>It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia</i></li> <li>Puffy in <i>There's Something About Mary</i></li> <li>Puffy's female offspring Raleigh, Clay Aiken's pet dog</li> <li>Scamp in <i>The Suite Life of Zack &amp; Cody</i>; Maddie's scruffy dog who falls in love with London Tipton's dog, Ivana</li> <li>Seymour in Futurama episode Jurassic Bark</li> <li>Shep Proudfoot, Greg Laswell's pet dog</li> <li>Shithead in <i>The Jerk</i></li> <li>Sorry in <i>Seeking a Friend for the End of the World</i>; Dodge's dog</li> <li>Tansy as Toto from <i>Return To Oz</i> (1985 film)</li> <li>Toots in <i>Lassie</i></li> <li>Tucker in Ehrman House</li> <li>Oscar as Scotty the Dog in <i>Ruby Sparks</i></li> <li>Brillo in Misfits as a street puppy eaten by new zombie Curtis</li> </ul> [button link=""http://alphamatch.com/listing-type/pets/?pet-type=1081&amp;breed-2=2177"" color=""black"" type=""big-button"" type=""Search for Border Terrier""]Search for Border Terrier[/button]",NULL,NULL,NULL,"Y","0"

This ""American Gentleman"" was accepted in 1893 by the American Kennel Club as a non-sporting breed. Color and markings are important when distinguishing this breed to the AKC standard. They should be either black, brindle or seal with white markings. Bostons are small and compact with a short tail and erect ears. The AKC says they are highly intelligent and very easily trained. They are friendly and can be stubborn at times. The average life span of a Boston is around 11 to 13 years, though some can live well into their teens.<sup id=""cite_ref-6""> </sup> [button link=""http://alphamatch.com/listing-type/pets/?pet-type=1081&amp;breed-2=3547"" color=""black"" type=""big-button"" type=""Search for Boston Terrier""]Search for Boston Terrier[/button] &nbsp; <h2>History</h2> The Boston Terrier breed originated around 1870, when Robert C. Hooper of Boston, purchased a dog Judge from Edward Burnettknown later as Hooper's Judge, who was of a Bull and Terrier type lineage. Hooper's Judge is either directly related to the original Bull and Terrier breeds of the 18th and early 19th centuries, or Judge is the result of modern English Bulldogs being crossed into terriers created in the 1860s for show purposes, like the White English Terrier. Judge weighed over 27.5 pounds (13.5 kilos). The offspring interbred with one or more French Bulldogs, providing the foundation for the Boston Terrier. Bred down in size from fighting dogs of the Bull and Terrier types, the Boston Terrier originally weighed up to 44 pounds (20 kg.) (Olde Boston Bulldogge). The breed was first shown in Boston in 1870. By 1889 the breed had become sufficiently popular in Boston that fanciers formed the American Bull Terrier Club, the breed's nickname, ""roundheads"". Shortly after, at the suggestion of James Watson (a noted writer and authority), the club changed its name to the Boston Terrier Club and in 1893 it was admitted to membership in the American Kennel Club, thus making it the first US breed to be recognized. It is one of a small number of breeds to have originated in the United States. The Boston Terrier was the first non-sporting dog bred in the US. In the early years, the color and markings were not very important, by the 20th century the breed's distinctive markings and color were written into the standard, becoming an essential feature. Terrier only in name, the Boston Terrier has lost most of its ruthless desire for mayhem, preferring the company of humans, although some males will still challenge other dogs if they feel their territory is being invaded. Boston University's mascot is Rhett the Boston Terrier. The Boston Terrier is also the mascot of Wofford College in Spartanburg, S.C. <h2>Description</h2> <h3>Appearance</h3> Boston Terriers are compactly built, well proportioned with erect ears, short tails and a short muzzle that is generally free of wrinkles.<sup id=""cite_ref-CKC_4-1""> </sup> <h4>Size</h4> According to international breed standard, the dog should weigh no less than 10 pounds and no more than 25 pounds. Boston Terriers usually stand 15-17 inches at the withers.<sup id=""cite_ref-AKC_3-1""> </sup> <h4>Coat and color</h4> The Boston Terrier is characteristically marked with white in proportion to either black, brindle, seal, or a combination of the three. However, there are also liver, brown, cream or red and white Boston Terriers, although these colors are not considered desirable by theAmerican Kennel Club.<sup id=""cite_ref-AKC_3-2""> </sup><sup id=""cite_ref-CKC_4-2""></sup> According to the American Kennel Club an ideal Boston Terrier should have white that covers its chest, muzzle, band around the neck, half way up the forelegs, up to the hocks on the rear legs, and a white blaze between but not touching the eyes. For conformation showing, symmetrical markings are preferred. Due to the Boston Terrier's markings resembling formal wear, in addition to its refined and pleasant personality, the breed is commonly referred to as the ""American Gentleman."" <sup id=""cite_ref-Meade_2-2""> </sup> <h3>Temperament</h3> The Boston Terrier is a gentle breed that typically has a strong, happy-go-lucky and friendly personality. Bostons are generally eager to please their owner and can easily be trained given a patient owner. They are also very protective of their owners. While originally bred for fighting as well as hunting rats in garment factories, they were later down bred for companionship. The modern Boston Terrier can be gentle, alert, expressive, creative, and well-mannered. However, they are not considered terriers by the American Kennel Club, but are part of the non-sporting group.<sup id=""cite_ref-AKC_3-4""> </sup> Both females and males are generally quiet and bark only when necessary. Their usually sensible attitude towards barking makes them excellent choices for apartment dwellers. Having been bred as a companion dog, they enjoy being around people, and if properly socialized, get along well with children, the elderly, other canines, and non-canine pets.<sup id=""cite_ref-Meade_2-3""> </sup> <h2>Health</h2> Health issues are of concern in the Boston Terrier: cataracts (both juvenile and adult type), luxating patellas, deafness, heart murmur,mast cell tumors, and allergies. Curvature of the back, called roaching, might be caused by patella problems with the rear legs, which in turn causes the dog to lean forward onto the forelegs. This might also just be a structural fault with little consequence to the dog. Many Bostons cannot tolerate excessive heat and also extremely cold weather, due to the shortened muzzle, so hot or cold weather combined with demanding exercise can bring harm to a Boston Terrier. A sensitive digestive system is also typical of Boston Terriers. In the absence of proper diet, flatulence is associated with the breed. In some cases, even a proper diet cannot abate flatulence.<sup id=""cite_ref-8""> </sup> Bostons, along with Pug, Shih Tzu and other short-snouted breeds are brachycephalic breeds. The word comes from Greek roots ""Brachy,"" meaning short and ""cephalic,"" meaning head. This anatomy can cause tiny nostrils, long palates and a narrow trachea. Because of this, Bostons may be prone to snoring and reverse sneeze, a rapid and repeated forced inhalation through the nose, accompanied by snorting or gagging sounds used to clear the palate of mucus, which does not harm the dog in any way. Brachycephalic dogs may be prone to complications with general anesthesia. To decrease this risk, the owner should seek an experienced and knowledgeable vet to perform any necessary surgeries. Bostons frequently require caesarean section to give birth, with over 90% of litters in a UK Kennel Club survey delivered this way.<sup id=""cite_ref-11""> </sup><sup id=""cite_ref-Telegraph-CSection_12-0""></sup> [button link=""http://alphamatch.com/listing-type/pets/?pet-type=1081&amp;breed-2=3547"" color=""black"" type=""big-button"" type=""Search for Boston Terrier""]Search for Boston Terrier[/button]",NULL,NULL,NULL,"Y","0"

Their coat is smooth and tight-fitting; colors are fawn or brindled, with or without white markings, which may cover the entire body, and white. Boxers are brachycephalic (they have broad, short skulls), have a square muzzle, mandibular prognathism (an underbite), very strong jaws, and a powerful bite ideal for hanging on to large prey. The Boxer was bred from the Old English Bulldog and the now extinct Bullenbeisser, and is part of theMolosser group. Boxers were first exhibited in a dog show for St. Bernards in Munich in 1895, the first Boxer club being founded the next year. Based on 2012 American Kennel Club statistics, Boxers held steady as the seventh most popular breed of dog in the United States for the third consecutive year.<sup id=""cite_ref-RegStats_4-0""> </sup> [button link=""http://alphamatch.com/listings/?pet-type=1081"" color=""black"" type=""big-button"" type=""Search for Boxer""]Search for Boxer[/button] &nbsp; <h2>Appearance</h2> The head is the most distinctive feature of the Boxer. The breed standard dictates that it must be in perfect proportion to the body and above all it must never be too light. The greatest value is to be placed on the muzzle being of correct form and in absolute proportion to the skull. The length of the muzzle to the whole of the head should be a ratio of 1:3. Folds are always present from the root of the nose running downwards on both sides of the muzzle, and the tip of the nose should lie somewhat higher than the root of the muzzle. In addition a Boxer should be slightly prognathous, i.e., the lower jaw should protrude beyond the upper jaw and bend slightly upwards in what is commonly called an underbite or ""undershot bite"".<sup id=""cite_ref-BoxerBite_6-0""> </sup> Boxers were originally a docked and cropped breed, and this is still done in some countries. However, due to pressure from veterinary associations, animal rights groups, and the general public, both cropping of the ears and docking of the tail have been prohibited in many countries around the world. A line of naturally short-tailed (bobtail) Boxers was developed in the United Kingdom in anticipation of a tail docking ban there; after several generations of controlled breeding, these dogs were accepted in the Kennel Club (UK) registry in 1998, and today representatives of the bobtail line can be found in many countries around the world. However, in 2008, the FCI added a ""naturally stumpy tail"" as a disqualifying fault in their breed standard, meaning those Boxers born with a bobtail can no longer be shown in FCI member countries. In the United States and Canada as of 2012, cropped ears are still more common in show dogs, even though the practice of cosmetic cropping is currently opposed by the American Veterinary Medical Association. In March 2005 the AKC breed standard was changed to include a description of the uncropped ear, but to severely penalize an undocked tail. <h3>Coat and colors</h3> The Boxer is a short-haired breed, with a shiny, smooth coat that lies tight to the body. The recognized colors are fawn and brindle, frequently with a white underbelly and white on the feet. These white markings, called <i>flash</i>, often extend onto the neck or face, and dogs that have these markings are known as ""flashy"". ""Fawn"" denotes a range of color, the tones of which may be described variously as light tan or yellow, reddish tan, mahogany or stag/deer red, and dark honey-blonde. In the UK and Europe, fawn Boxers are typically rich in color and are often called ""red"". ""Brindle"" refers to a dog with black stripes on a fawn background. Some brindle Boxers are so heavily striped that they give the <i>appearance</i> of ""reverse brindling"", fawn stripes on a black body; these dogs are conventionally called ""reverse brindles"", but that is actually a misnomer?they are still fawn dogs with black stripes. In addition, the breed standards state that the fawn background must clearly contrast with or show through the brindling, so a dog that is too heavily brindled may be disqualified by the breed standard. The Boxer does not carry the gene for a solid black coat color and therefore purebred black Boxers do not exist.<sup id=""cite_ref-9""> </sup> <h2>Temperament</h2> <blockquote>The character of the Boxer is of the greatest importance and demands the most solicitous attention. He is renowned from olden times for his great love and faithfulness to his master and household. He is harmless in the family, but can be distrustful of strangers, bright and friendly of temperament at play, but brave and determined when aroused. His intelligence and willing tractability, his modesty and cleanliness make him a highly desirable family dog and cheerful companion. He is the soul of honesty and loyalty, and is never false or treacherous even in his old age. <div>? <i>1938 AKC Boxer breed standard</i><sup id=""cite_ref-StandardTemperament_14-0""> </sup></div></blockquote> Boxers are a bright, energetic and playful breed and tend to be very good with children. They are active, strong dogs and require adequate exercise to prevent boredom-associated behaviors such as chewing, digging, or licking. Boxers have earned a slight reputation of being ""headstrong,"" which can be related to inappropriate obedience training. Owing to their intelligence and working breed characteristics, training based on corrections often has limited usefulness. Boxers, like other animals, typically respond better to positive reinforcement techniques such as clicker training, an approach based on operant conditioning and behaviorism, which offers the dog an opportunity to think independently and to problem-solve. Stanley Coren's survey of obedience trainers, summarized in his book <i>The Intelligence of Dogs</i>, ranked Boxers at #48 ? average working/obedience intelligence. Many who have worked with Boxers disagree quite strongly with Coren's survey results, and maintain that a skilled trainer who uses reward-based methods will find Boxers have far above-average intelligence and working ability.<sup id=""cite_ref-EBB_15-1""> </sup><sup id=""cite_ref-Gazette_Intelligence_17-0""></sup> The Boxer by nature is not an aggressive or vicious breed. It is an instinctive guardian and can become very attached to its family. Like all dogs, it requires proper socialization. Boxers are generally patient with smaller dogs and puppies, but difficulties with larger adult dogs, especially those of the same sex, may occur. Boxers are generally more comfortable with companionship, in either human or canine form. <h2>Health</h2> <div></div> Leading health issues to which Boxers are prone include cancers, heart conditions such as Aortic Stenosis and Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy (the so-called ""Boxer Cardiomyopathy""), hypothyroidism, hip dysplasia, and degenerative myelopathy and epilepsy; other conditions that may be seen are gastric dilatation and torsion (bloat), intestinal problems, and allergies (although these may be more related to diet than breed). <sup id=""cite_ref-BoxerHealth1_27-0""></sup>Entropion, a malformation of the eyelid requiring surgical correction, is occasionally seen, and some lines have a tendency toward spondylosis deformans, a fusing of the spine, or dystocia. Other conditions that are less common but occur more often in Boxers than other breeds are hystiocytic ulcerative colitis (sometimes called Boxer colitis), an invasive E. coli infection, and indolent corneal ulcers, often called Boxer eye ulcers. According to a UK Kennel Club health survey, cancer accounts for 38.5% of Boxer deaths, followed by old age (21.5%), cardiac (6.9%) and gastrointestinal (6.9%) related issues. Average age of death was 9 years and 8 months. Responsible breeders use available tests to screen their breeding stock before breeding, and in some cases throughout the life of the dog, in an attempt to minimize the occurrence of these diseases in future generations.<sup id=""cite_ref-BoxerHealth3_33-0""> </sup> Boxers are known to be very sensitive to the hypotensive and bradycardiac effects of a commonly used veterinary sedative, acepromazine. It is recommended that the drug be avoided in the Boxer breed.<sup id=""cite_ref-ace2_35-0""> </sup> As an athletic breed, proper exercise and conditioning is important for the continued health and longevity of the Boxer. Care must be taken not to over-exercise young dogs, as this may damage growing bones; however once mature Boxers can be excellent jogging or running companions. Because of their brachycephalic head, they do not do well with high heat or humidity, and common sense should prevail when exercising a Boxer in these conditions.

Height at the withers for males ranges from 15.5 - 17 ins (39.4 - 43.18 cm) and weight 30 - 40 lbs (13.6 - 18.2 kg). Females are smaller, 14 - 16.5 ins (35 - 41.91 cm) and 25 - 35 lbs (11.4 - 15.9 kg). Although against the true form and function of the breed, some field trial breeders are increasing their line's size to be competitive against other retriever breeds. Buyers should be aware of the size and weight in the puppy's pedigree before choosing a breeder if size is a factor in their choice of dog. Traditionally, its tail is docked at the age of three days, leaving 1/3 length. Eyes are engaging and bright. The color ranges from brilliant gold to a dark amber. Puppies will have milky bluish-gold to amber eyes until a few months old. The coat color comes in liver or chocolate (shades of brown.) This is a southern water spaniel bred to only adapt to the moderate climate of the southeastern USA. Coat length and density vary widely due to the variety of breeds that make up the recent background of this breed. Any coat type is acceptable, with some being almost curly like an American Water Spaniel to some with very straight fur like a Field Spaniel. Length is normally 1-2 inches throughout the body. A few bloodlines throw shorter, straight coats much like a Labrador. Feathering on the ears, chest, through the tuck-up and along the legs can be very little to moderate in density and length. Feathering may take on a sun-bleached golden to tawny color especially on the ears and should not be penalized. Groomed dogs should have a minimal of stripping or clipping, with slight shaping around the head and topline. Some individuals have a topknot like a Llewellin Setter. Field types are often shaved down and should not be penalized as long as it is of appropriate length to protect the skin. Improper shaving will result in some coats growing back in with excessive discoloration, fading or graying. White markings other than a mark on the chest, or a white mark on the chest that is more than 60% of the width of the chest, disqualify puppies from being registered with the Boykin Spaniel Society, although the American Kennel Club and United Kennel Club do not allow denial of registration for conformation reasons. White on the toes or chest is purely a cosmetic trait and will not affect the ability or health of the dog. <h2>Hunting use</h2> The Boykin Spaniel is a versatile hunter, working as a retriever and upland hunter, flushing birds into flight. Pointing is not in character with the Boykin's hunting style. Their stamina in hot weather and eagerness make them good for dove hunts, but also for pheasant and other upland game. They can be used in driving deer or in tracking wounded game. Their small size makes them easy to carry in a canoe or other small boat, and they are described as ""the dog that doesn't rock the boat."" The Boykin was officially recognized by the AKC in 2009. <h2>History</h2> The first Boykin Spaniel, or the precursor of today's breed, was reportedly a small, stray spaniel type dog that befriended a banker walking from his home to the First Presbyterian Church in Spartanburg, South Carolina around 1905-1910. Alexander L. White (1860-1942) liked the little dog and took it home. After the dog showed some aptitude for retrieving, White sent the dog called ""Dumpy"" to his longtime friend and hunting partner Whit Boykin. L. Whitaker Boykin (1861?1932) experimented with crossbreeding different breeds, and the resulting dog is named after him. In Boykin's hands the little stray developed into a superb turkey dog and waterfowl retriever. This dog became the foundation stock for the Boykin spaniel. The dogs had to be small enough to ride in the small boats used by hunters in the swamps. The Chesapeake Bay Retriever, Springer Spaniel, Cocker Spaniel, and the American Water Spaniel may have been used in the development of the breed. The area in which the breed developed, around Camden, South Carolina, was a resort area, and the breed was noticed by visitors and so spread around the United States. The <i>Boykin Spaniel Society</i> was formed in 1977 and began maintaining a studbook in 1979. The BSS studbook has been ""closed"" since 1982, meaning that only dogs from BSS registered parents may be registered with the BSS. The Boykin Spaniel was recognized by the United Kennel Club in 1985. UKC does not close its studbooks so dogs from the BSS or the AKC may be registered into the UKC studbook at any time. In the 1990s a group of fanciers formed the <i>Boykin Spaniel Club And Breeders Association of America</i> in order to achieve AKC recognition of the breed and to gain access to the AKC Spaniel Hunt Tests and AKC Spaniel Field Trials held throughout the nation. The BSCBAA was the first Boykin Spaniel organization to form and maintain a ""Code of Ethics"". In 2007 the Boykin Spaniel Club And Breeders Association of America was recognized by the AKC as the parent club for the breed. <h2>Health</h2> Boykin Spaniels have a 37% chance of being born with hip dysplasia, according to 2006 statistics. Puppies can be checked by a local veterinarian for this problem at the age of 2 years old by an Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) x-ray or as young as 4 months old by aPennHIP exam. All breeding stock should receive either a passing PennHIP evaluation or an OFA certification prior to being bred. The breed also has a high incidence of eye problems and patella luxation. Debilitating seizures have also been reported within the breed. Skin and coat problems do exist and may be linked to thyroid or endocrine disorders. Cushings disease and hypothyroidism are known in the breed. Isolated incidences in individuals and litters for heart and elbow problems have been diagnosed.<sup> </sup> In early 2010 Exercise Induced Collapse (EIC) was positively identified in the breed by the University of MN in conjunction with the AKC health group and registered in the OFA database. On pressure from their membership, the BSS conducted a study which resulted in 56% of the study Boykins to have one or 2 copies of the gene that causes EIC. This is a shockingly high level; the highest of any breed currently being tested for the disease. DNA testing of this autosomal recessive disease can absolutely identify carriers (one copy of the gene) and affected (2 copies of the gene)individuals. The UMN has identified one-copy/carriers to also exhibit the possible life-threatening symptoms of the disease. Multiple bloodlines tracing back to many commonly used foundation dogs may be involved and further widespread testing is being performed by the college. The BSS and BSCBAA Code of Ethics for member breeders mandates that dogs to be bred should be tested for hips, hereditary eye disease, and heart/cardiac (specifically pulmunary stenosis), as well as for other diseases that may have a genetic component such as allergies, elbow dysplasia, and patella luxation. The join venture of the AKC and OFA is called the CHIC (Canine Health Information Center) database.<sup id=""cite_ref-13"">[13]</sup> For a CHIC number the dogs must have an annual CERF test for eyes, an OFA test for patellar luxation, and a test for hip dysplasia. Owners must agree to publicly publish the results in the OFA or CERF databases. Optional tests are a heart test and an elbow dysplasia test.<sup id=""cite_ref-14"">[14]</sup> Obtaining a CHIC certification does not mean a dog has passed their evaluations; it is merely an indication that the owner checked for the health diseases in the Boykin Spaniel. Testing and conscientious breeding can reduce the incidence of these problems, and puppy buyers should request results of these tests. The Orthopedic Foundation for Animals evaluated 157 breeds of dog between January 1974 through to December 2009. The Boykin Spaniel ranked thirteenth worst for hip dysplasia with 34.8% of dogs affected.<sup id=""cite_ref-ofa_15-0"">[15]</sup> Update: As of December 2011, the Boykin Spaniel ranked #14 with 2890 evaluations submitted to OFA and 33.7 percent evaluated by OFA as dysplastic. The BSCBAA is part of the AKC Canine Health Foundation. As a part of the program, the parent club is allocated money on a yearly basis to direct to grants of their choice. The AKC CHF hosts free online podcasts, has donated millions of dollars to research grants and veterinary scholarships, and offers nationwide representation for clinics and events to benefit all dog breeds. The BSCBAA participates in the Purina Pro Club. The Boykin Spaniel Foundation (BSF), a 501(c)(3) entity and wholly owned subsidiary of the Boykin Spaniel Society founded in 2008. They have promoted club participation in the Purina Pro Club for many years and have banked the AKC CHF matching funding to over $10,000.00 total DAF funds by 2009. The AKC CHF and Purina Pro Club developed this program to help all breeds of dogs and allow the breed clubs to self-govern their DAF. This step of the BSF working in conjunction with the AKC CHF and Purina Pro Club is a welcome to those who see health as a priority. Most of the BSF funds are raised by taxing BSS litter registrations and from reducing their support of the BSR (Boykin Spaniel Rescue) in 2009. The BSF sponsors eye and heart clinics at its National Upland Field Trial and National Field Trial in January and March of each year. Clinics are limited only twice a year and only available in South Carolina. The clinics are provided at no charge to BSS members, with a limit of one BSS registered Boykin Spaniel per family. The BSF also has a program that provides a one time reimbursement of $75 to its members (membership must be current &amp; dog must be BSS registered) to defray the cost of radiographs and subsequent evaluation by the OFA to BSS registered dogs only. The BSS notifies the member when his or her dog reaches eligibility age (24 months) and encourages participation in the program with the long term goal of improving genetics within the breed. The hip program has been funded since 2006 but is subject to cancellation each year at the recommendation of the BSF. <h2>Temperament</h2> The Boykin Spaniel is a friendly, social dog that is considered a good family pet. It is easily trained and eager to work. It is good with, and extremely stable around, children and other dogs. They can sometimes be described as energetic with great endurance that lasts throughout the day. They are extremely adaptable to different environments as long as they are given ample opportunity for social interaction and plenty of time to burn off excess energy. They are not easily angered and tend to be eager to please and friendly, but they love attention. Boykins have great energy reserves and will always outlast you in any activity you choose. <h2>Care</h2> As with all dogs, the Boykin Spaniels require daily exercise and regular grooming. Clipping the coat regularly is recommended especially if the dog is in the field, as the soft coat collects foxtails and briars. Spraying the dog with cooking spray is also recommended to help defend against tangles in the long fur.

[button link=""http://alphamatch.com/listings/?pet-type=1081&amp;breed-2=3481"" color=""black"" type=""big-button"" type=""Search for Bracco Italiano""]Search for Bracco Italiano[/button] &nbsp; <h2>Description</h2> The Bracco - or Italian Pointer- should be athletic and powerful in appearance, most resembling a cross between a German Shorthaired Pointer and a Bloodhound, although it is nothing like them in character. It has pendulous upper lips and long ears that create a serious expression. It should be ""almost square"", meaning that its height at the withers should be almost the same as the length of its body. It should not however be actually square as this would render its famous rear driving push off and front/rear extension to be compromised, thus losing much of its powerful grace. The tail can be docked, mostly due to the strong possibility of injury in rough/dense terrain when hunting, however there has been a sea-change in Italy, with some now working the breed with full tail. <h3>Coat and colour</h3> <div> <div><b>The Bracco Italiano has a distinctive solemn facial expression.</b></div> </div> The coat is short, dense, and glossy. The texture should be fairly hard, though somewhat shorter and softer on the head, throat, ears, legs, and feet. Shedding happens a couple of times a year, and a hound glove really helps in removing dead coat. The most common colours are <i>Bianco-Arancio</i> - <b>White-Orange</b> and <i>Roano-Marrone</i> -<b>Roano-Brown</b>, chestnut, or amber coloured patches on the face, ears, base of tail, and body. Black on the coat is a fault, as are ""three-color"" dogs, such as orange/white with chestnut spottings above the eyes, on the muzzle and legs, such as the pattern of a Doberman or Rottweiler. weight is 25?40 kilograms (55?88 lb). <h3>Movement</h3> The gait, when hunting, starts out as a gallop, but slows to a long trot as the dog comes into scent. This trot should be long and fluid, with plenty of reach and drive (the 'almost square' body contributes to this). As a Bracco comes closer and closer to scent, the gait slows to a creep, and settles into a non-moving ""point"", with a front leg usually held up in the classic pointing dog position. The head should be held above the topline, which facilitates the air scenting for which this breed is known. A well-built Bracco, with a full and developed musculature covering, is an attractive mover and covers a lot of ground. <h3>Temperament</h3> Braccos are very much a people-loving dog and thrive on human companionship, having a strong need to be close to their people. They are a particularly good family dog, and many have a strong love of children. They get along well with other dogs and pets, if trained to do so - it is, afterall, a hunting breed - and must be taught what to chase and what not to. They are very willing to please as long as they have decided that your idea is better than theirs. Obedience training is a must for a Bracco, and the more is asked of them, the better they do. Harsh reprimands do not work with this breed unless the reprimand is a fair one - and harshness must occasionally be used with some dogs to remind them who is actually in charge. Although not an aggressive breed, many Braccos will alert if there is a reason, and some will bark or growl if there's a good reason. The breed loves to hunt, and they excel at it - in fact, a non-hunting Bracco is not a happy Bracco, and will act out in various other ways. Hunting without a gun is an area in which the Bracco can excel and this can be a great opportunity for training the dog to connect with the owner. They are an active breed, but require more mental exercise than physical exercise to keep them happy- but regular free running will actually entertain both their minds and senses satisfactorily and so should be encouraged. <h2>History</h2> The Bracco Italiano originated in Italy, and there are writings concerning the breed that date back to the 4th and 5th centuries BC. It is believed to be a cross between a Segugio Italiano (a coursing hound) and the Asiatic Mastiff. Others claim the breed goes back to the St. Hubert Hound. Undoubtedly, both hounds and gundogs are in the breed's ancestry for there was an old practice of mating these together to produce a dog capable of pointing, but with more stamina.<sup> </sup> There are two variations of the breed. The first originated in Piedmont, and was for that reason known as the Piedmontese Pointer. The other originated in Lombardy, and was known as the Lombard Pointer. The Bracco from Piedmont is lighter in color and build than the Lombard variety, probably due to the mountainous terrain there. It was well established by the Middle Ages. The Bracco thrived during the Renaissance and was bred by both the Medici and Gonzaga families. The Italian standard for the breed was released in 1949 from the <i>S.A.B.I.

Jack Russell Terriers were brought to Brazil from Europe in the 1800s and served as the nearest ancestor of the Brazilian Terrier. Breeds such as Miniature Pinschers and large Chihuahuas were also crossed with J.R. Terriers to develop this dog. It is said that this kind of breed is rarely found outside Brazil. <h3>Appearance</h3> This <b>terrier</b> stands between 14-16 in (35.5-40.5 cm) at the withers. Its coat is always tri-color (white and tan with black). A docked tail, narrow chest, flat triangular skull and a well balanced body are the most common characteristics. <h3>Temperament</h3> The temperament of this breed is very similar to a Jack Russell Terrier, very alert, perky, intelligent and alert. Very friendly, loves to play and dig holes. Spirited and obedient but fearless, as watchdogs they will only bark to get your attention and then leave the rest up to you. This breed needs a firm, consistent and confident pack leader, otherwise, they will become willful and determined. Their hunting instinct is the strongest among average terriers and should not be trusted with other small animals. <h3>Living conditions, exercise, and grooming</h3> Small apartments or spaces are not good for this type of dog, because they are very active, an average size yard is highly recommended. It also needs both, physical and mental activities to be happy, a common tendency is becoming destructive and restless if kept indoor, long daily walks is the best option.

A Briard-type dog appears in Gaston Febus' <i>Livre de chasse</i> (""Book of the Hunt""), written in the 14th century. According to legend, about the same time, a Briard fought a judicial duelwith Robert Macaire to avenge its owner's murder, Aubry of Montdidier. Charlemagne, Napoleon, Thomas Jefferson, and Lafayette are all said to have owned Briards.<sup id=""cite_ref-1"">[1]</sup>It became popular after the Paris dog show of 1863, after the breed had been fixed, with crosses with the Beauceron and the Barbet. During the First World War, the Briard was used, almost to the point of extinction, by the French Army as a sentry, messenger, and to search for wounded soldiers. The Briard's modern-day roles include police, military and search-and-rescue work, as well as companion dog. [button link=""http://alphamatch.com/listings/?pet-type=1081&amp;breed-2=3579"" color=""black"" type=""big-button"" type=""Search for Briard""]Search for Briard[/button] &nbsp; <h2>History</h2> They were originally bred to herd as well as guard flocks of sheep. And they were often left to their own devices in order to accomplish their assigned tasks. This makes the Briard different from those breeds that only guard and those that only herd. The breeds that just herd are often smaller in size, agile, and swift of foot. Those breeds that just guard are usually larger and heavier. Briards were used in all types of herding situations, having the ability to learn many commands and fulfill the jobs expected of them. The Briard was most commonly used as a farm dog in the more crowded farming valleys of France, where row crops were grown. Sheep were allowed to graze the grass strips between crops and Briards were responsible for keeping the sheep moving along these strips, and preventing the sheep from eating the crops. The Briard moved the sheep daily from the farm to the graze areas and back again at night. At the farm, the Briard was the shepherd?s partner, helping with livestock chores. The Briard was also used to move large flocks of sheep in areas of France that had wide grazing pastures and mountain pastures in summer. Those flocks were moved on foot, to the grazing areas, much like large sheep ranches do in the western United States and Canada. The Briards were usually worked beside one or two other breeds to keep the sheep from straying and herd the sheep to the proper areas. At night, they were alert and vigilant watchdogs, protecting the shepherds and flock from wolves and thieves.<sup id=""cite_ref-2""> </sup> <h2>Description</h2> <h3>Appearance</h3> The Briard can be tawny, black or gray however there are variations in each color. Briards stand 58 to 69 cm (22 to 27 inches) at the withers. Ear cropping has been common in the breed, although more breeders are leaving the ears in their natural state since ear cropping is becoming illegal in most European countries, including the Briard's land of origin, France. When cropped, the ears should stand erect and parallel with the base being wide and tapering to a rounded point with hair covering the opening. Their long coat requires an extensive amount of grooming. The outer coat is coarse, hard and dry (making a dry rasping sound between the fingers). It lies down flat, falling naturally in long, slightly waving locks, having the sheen of good health. On the shoulders the length of the hair is generally six inches or more. The undercoat is fine and tight on all the body. The head is well covered with hair which lies down, forming a natural part in the center. The eyebrows do not lie flat but, instead, arch up and out in a curve that lightly veils the eyes. The hair is never so abundant that it masks the form of the head or completely covers the eyes. Briards come in a variety from different colors and the ones with lighter colors are often mistaken for haystacks.

Although the Brittany is often referred to as a Spaniel, the breed's working characteristics are more akin to those of a pointer or setter. <h2>History</h2> The name ""Brittany"" is taken from the region of the same name in northwestern France. Images of Brittanys were first seen on tapestries and paintings from the 17th century. These images depicted orange and white dogs hunting and retrieving game. The first written and verifiable record of Brittanys comes from a hunting description written by Reverend Davies in 1850. Davies described hunting with small ""bobtailed"" dogs who were pointed and were excellent retrievers. It was around the same time that the modern Brittany is rumored to have been bred by mating with English Setters. First shown at the Paris Dog Show in 1900, the Brittany had already been known in Europe for centuries. The Brittany was first recognized as a breed in 1907 when an orange and white male named ""Boy"" was registered in France. As a result, the first standards were outlined in the same year. America first recognized the Brittany in 1931 and the breed was approved by the American Kennel Club in 1934. In 1982 the ""Spaniel"" was officially dropped from the name and the breed became simply known as ""Brittany."" <h2>Description</h2> <h3>Appearance</h3> A Brittany is typically quite athletic, compact, energetic, and solidly built without being heavy. Other characteristics include long legs and floppy ears. Their expressions are usually of intelligence, vigour, and alertness. Their gait is elastic, long, and free. Some Brittanys are born with naturally short tails and others with long tails. If born with a long tail it is normally docked to a length of 3?10 centimetres (1.2?3.9 in). Brittanys come in a variety of colors: orange and white coat or liver and white are most common in the American Brittany; other colours include orange roan and liver roan, all of which are acceptable in the show ring. The American Brittany Standard does specify an acceptable tri-colour of liver, orange, and white with very specific color placement which is also acceptable in the show ring. <h3>Size</h3> Brittanys should range in a height of 17?20.5 inches (43?52 cm) at the withers (17.5?20.5 inches (44?52 cm) in America), with females at the lower end and males taller. The measurements of 17.5?20.5 inches (44?52 cm) inches were adopted and approved by the AKC as the standard in 1990. A properly constructed and healthy Brittany maintains a weight between 36?43 pounds (16?20 kg), depending upon height. North American field lines tend to be larger, with many dogs reaching a healthy weight of 45?50 pounds (20?23 kg). Brittanys are medium-sized dogs, and measure on average 50 centimetres (20 in) at the shoulder. <h4>Types</h4> Many breeders differentiate between ""American"" Brittanys and ""French"" style Brittanys due to the (disputed) addition of English Setter blood to the original French breeding. Although generally recognized as sub-sets of the same breed, there are recognizable differences between the two. The Brittany is typically larger than the French Brittany and a bigger running dog while the smaller French Brittany generally works more closely to the guns, but will work according to the local terrain. However, some breeders consider these ""differences"" to be unsound generalizations and that American standards should be updated to reflect the breed's standard in its country of origin, i.e. France, where black has become an acceptable coat colour since 1956 while it is still considered a fault in America. Originally known as the Brittany Spaniel, the word ""spaniel"" was dropped in the U.S. some years ago, as the American Brittany Club persuaded the American Kennel Club to discontinue the use of the term ""spaniel"" for this breed. When translating the Latin version of the Brittany's name, it was assumed that spaniel was attached, as the Brittany does resemble a spaniel-like dog. Spaniels, such as Springers and Cockers, are used for flushing game, while Brittanys are more akin to pointers and all-purpose sporting dogs. Known in the United Kingdom as an HPR breed (Hunt, point, and retrieve), they are expected to point and retrieve all birds and ground game up to and including hare. These unique qualities of the Brittany have given it top spot as the breed with the most Dual Champions of all the AKC Sporting Breeds. This landmark was reached in 2006 with the 500th Dual Champion Brittany.<sup id=""cite_ref-clubs.akc.org_2-1""> </sup> <h3>Temperament</h3> The breed was originally bred as a hunting dog and noted for being easy to train and sweet-natured. The breed is generally more sensitive to correction than other hunting breeds, and harsh corrections are often unnecessary. Brittanys are all around sound dogs, as they are excellent family pets as well as working dogs in the field. Brittanys are eager to please, friendly, and sometimes sensitive dogs. They generally learn quickly and are loyal and attached to their owners. They are great with kids. Brittanys are energetic dogs, and need at least an hour of vigorous exercise every day. The dogs are active and require frequent exercise and room to run, and a fenced yard is essential. At least one long walk is required daily to satisfy the needs of most Brittanys, and many Brittanys will need more than this. The Brittany makes an ideal companion for an active owner. The breed sometimes gets a reputation for being crazy or uncontrollable, but these problems are almost invariably due to lack of exercise and training, and are not commonly seen in well cared-for dogs.<sup id=""cite_ref-paws_3-1""> </sup> Brittanys can become very shy if not thoroughly socialized, and even among well-socialized dogs there is significant variation in levels of friendliness. Socialization is very important, and they must be socialized at a young age. These breeds are easy to train, and are eager to please. With more American dual champions (dogs with titles in both conformation shows and field trials) than any other breed, the Brittany maintains strong hunting instincts in all bloodlines. <h2>Health</h2> Brittanys are generally healthy and hardy dogs. UK Kennel Club survey puts the median lifespan of the breed at 12 years 11 months. About 1 in 5 dogs died of old age at an average of 14?15 years. Because of their floppy ears, which tend to trap moisture in the ear canal, Brittanys should have their ears cleaned regularly. Hip dysplasia is known to affect some members of the breed, and statistics compiled by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals show that 14.9% of Brittanys tested between 1974 and 2009 were considered dysplastic, with the incidence of hip dysplasia being reduced to 10.3% for dogs born 2003-2004. Epilepsy has also been known to occur in the breed. American fanciers encourage owners of affected dogs to submit DNA to UC Davis Veterinary Genetics Lab for their ongoing research into the Brittany and canine health. Brittanys are also listed among the breeds that are commonly affected by Canine discoid lupus erythematosus. Aside from plenty of exercise, Brittanys are low-requirement, healthy dogs and are easy to handle. They need minimal grooming unlike Labs and Shepherds, they are ""single-coated"". The hair that sheds from other dogs comes from the very fine undercoat. The Brittany lacks this undercoat and is, therefore, known by owners to shed little.

The Bruno Jura Hound is a skilled scent follower and is capable of following the slightest trace of a scent over the rough terrain of the Jura mountains. It needs firm handling if kept solely for companionship. Its size is similar to that of the Schweizer Laufhund, but it differs in the broadness of its head. It is related to the Bloodhound. The life expectancy of Bruno Jura hound is 12?13 years. An adult hound can weigh anywhere from 34 to 44 pounds (15.5?20 kg) and is from usually 17 to 23 inches (43?58 cm) tall. Also called the Jura Laufhund, this dog is an excellent hunter of fox, hare, and small deer. Closely related to the St. Hubert Jura Hound, its head resembles the neighboring French hounds form which it descends. Not common as a companion, the Bruno Jura Hound needs specialized training if it is to be kept for this purpose. Coming in a variety of colors, the Jura Hound was developed in the Jura Mountains in the Swiss-French border.

They have large, egg-shaped heads, and small triangular eyes. There is also a miniature version of this breed which is officially known as the Miniature Bull Terrier. [button link=""http://alphamatch.com/listings/?pet-type=1081&amp;breed-2=2566"" color=""black"" type=""big-button"" type=""Search for Bull Terrier""]Search for Bull Terrier[/button] <h2>Appearance</h2> The Bull Terrier's most recognisable feature is its head, described as 'egg shaped' when viewed from the front, the top of the skull is almost flat from ear to ear. Profile curves gently downwards from top of skull to tip of nose which should be black and bent downwards at tip. Nostrils are well developed and under-jaw deep and strong snout. The unique triangle-shaped eyes are small, dark, and deep-set. The body is full and round, while the shoulders are robust and very muscular and the tail is carried horizontally. They are generally white in colour, walk with a jaunty gait, and are popularly known as the 'Gladiator of the canine race'.<sup id=""cite_ref-1""> </sup> <h2>Temperament</h2> Bull Terriers are known to be courageous, playful, and active. They enjoy being around people but are strong willed and thus require an assertive owner; as such the Bull Terrier is not recommended for households with small children if the owner is a first time Bull Terrier owner. Bull Terriers are affectionate and need the companionship of their owners and should not be kept outside in a kennel. Bull Terriers can be both independent and stubborn and for this reason are not considered suitable for an inexperienced dog owner. They are protective of their family, although comprehensive socialisation at an early age will prevent them from becoming over-protective and neurotic. Bull Terriers have a strong prey instinct and, like any strong dog breed, when unduly challenged may cause injury or death to other animals, especially cats. That said, puppies brought up with cats and other animals get on well with the animals they know;. Early socialisation will ensure that the dogs will get along with other dogs and animals. <h2>Health</h2> All puppies should be checked for deafness, which occurs in 20% of pure white dogs and 1.3% of dogs and is difficult to notice, especially in a relatively young puppy. Many Bull Terriers have a tendency to develop skin allergies.Insect bites, such as those fromfleas, and sometimes mosquitoes and mites, can produce a generalised allergic response of hives, rash, and itching. This problem can be stopped by keeping the dog free of contact from these insects, but this is definitely a consideration in climates or circumstances where exposure to these insects is inevitable. A UK breed survey puts their median lifespan at 10 years and their mean at 9 years, with a good number of dogs living to 10?15 years.<sup id=""cite_ref-8""> </sup> <h2>History</h2> Early in the mid-19th century the ""Bull and Terrier"" breeds were developed to satisfy the needs for vermin control and animal-based blood sports. The ""Bull and Terriers"" were based on the Old English Bulldog (now extinct) and one or more of Old English Terrier and ""Black and tan terrier"", now known as Manchester Terrier. This new breed combined the speed and dexterity of lightly built terriers with the dour tenacity of the Bulldog, which was a poor performer in most combat situations, having been bred almost exclusively for fighting bulls and bears tied to a post. Many breeders began to breed bulldogs with terriers, arguing that such a mixture enhances the quality of fighting. Despite the fact that a cross between a bulldog and a terrier was of high value, very little or nothing was done to preserve the breed in its original form. Due to the lack of breed standards?breeding was for performance, not appearance?the ""Bull and Terrier"" eventually divided into the ancestors of ""Bull Terriers"" and ""Staffordshire Bull Terriers"", both smaller and easier to handle than the progenitor.<sup id=""cite_ref-Canterbury_Bull_Terrier_Club_9-0""> </sup><sup id=""cite_ref-Bull_and_Terrier_Breeds_12-0""></sup> About 1850, James Hinks started breeding ""Bull and Terriers"" with ""English White Terriers"" (now extinct), looking for a cleaner appearance with better legs and nicer head. In 1862, Hinks entered a bitch called ""Puss"" sired by his white Bulldog called ""Madman"" into the Bull Terrier Class at the dog show held at the Cremorne Gardens in Chelsea. Originally known as the ""Hinks Breed"" and ""The White Cavalier"", these dogs did not yet have the now-familiar ""egg face"", but kept the stop in the skull profile.<sup id=""cite_ref-Bull_Terrier_13-0""> </sup><sup id=""cite_ref-Bull_Terrier_History_15-0""></sup> The dog was immediately popular and breeding continued, using Dalmatian, Greyhound,Spanish Pointer, Foxhound and Whippet to increase elegance and agility; and Borzoi andCollie to reduce the stop. Hinks wanted his dogs white, and bred specifically for this. Generally, however, breeding was aimed at increasing sturdiness: three ""subtypes"" were recognised by judges, Bulldog, Terrier and Dalmatian, each with its specific conformation, and a balance is now sought between the three. The first modern Bull Terrier is now recognised as ""Lord Gladiator"", from 1917, being the first dog with no stop at all.<sup id=""cite_ref-Canterbury_Bull_Terrier_Club_9-1""> </sup><sup id=""cite_ref-17""></sup> Due to medical problems associated with all-white breeding, Ted Lyon among others began introducing colour, using Staffordshire Bull Terriers in the early 20th century. Coloured Bull Terriers were recognised as a separate variety (at least by the AKC) in 1936. Brindle is the preferred colour, but other colours are welcome.<sup id=""cite_ref-Bull_Terrier_History_15-1""> </sup><sup id=""cite_ref-18""></sup> Along with conformation, specific behaviour traits were sought. The epithet ""White cavalier"", harking back to an age of chivalry, was bestowed on a breed which while never seeking to start a fight was well able to finish one, while socialising well with its ""pack"", including children and pups. Hinks himself had always aimed at a ""gentleman's companion"" dog rather than a pit-fighter?though Bullies were often entered in the pits, with some success.

There are generally thick folds of skin on a Bulldog's brow; round, black, wide-set eyes; a short muzzle with characteristic folds called rope above the nose; hanging skin under the neck; drooping lips and pointed teeth, and occasionally an underbite. The coat is short, flat, and sleek, with colors of red, fawn, white, brindle, and piebald. <div>Example of four-year-old English Bulldog of champion bloodline, side view.

In the United States, a typical mature male weighs 45 to 55 pounds. Mature females weigh in at about 45 pounds. Bulldogs are one of the few breeds whose tail is naturally short and either straight or screwed and thus is not cut or docked as with some other breeds. A straight tail is a more desirable tail according the breed standard set forth by the BCA if it is facing downward, not upwards. <h3>Temperament</h3> According to the American Kennel Club (AKC), a Bulldog's disposition should be ""equable and kind, resolute, and courageous (not vicious or aggressive), and demeanor should be pacific and dignified. These attributes should be countenanced by the expression and behavior.""<sup id=""cite_ref-AKC_Bulldog_Page_3-0""> </sup> Breeders have worked to reduce/remove aggression from these dogs. Eventually, the Bulldog is known to be of good temperament. Most have a friendly, patient nature. Generally, Bulldogs are known for getting along well with children, other dogs, and pets. They can become so attached to home and family, that they will not venture out of the yard without a human companion. They are also more likely to sleep on someone's lap than chase a ball around the yard. <h2>History</h2> The term ""Bulldog"" was first mentioned in literature around 1500, the oldest spelling of the word being Bondogge and Bolddogge. The first reference to the word with the modern spelling is dated 1631 or 1632 in a letter by a man named Preswick Eaton where he writes: ""procuer mee two good Bulldogs, and let them be sent by ye first shipp."" The name ""bull"" was applied because of the dog's use in the sport of bull baiting. This entailed the setting of dogs (after placing wagers on each dog) onto a tethered bull. The dog that grabbed the bull by the nose and pinned it to the ground would be the victor. <span style=""font-size: 13px;"">It was common for a bull to maim or kill several dogs at such an event, either by goring, tossing, or trampling. Over the centuries, dogs used for bull-baiting developed the stocky bodies and massive heads and jaws that typify the breed as well as a ferocious and savage temperament. Bull-baiting, along with bear-baiting, reached the peak of its popularity in England in the early 1800s until they were both made illegal by the </span><span style=""font-size: small;"">Cruelty to Animals Act 1835</span><span style=""font-size: 13px;"">. This amended the existing legislation to protect animals from mistreatment and included (as ""cattle"") bulls, dogs, bears, and sheep, so that bull and bear-baiting as well as </span><span style=""font-size: small;"">cockfighting</span><span style=""font-size: 13px;""> became prohibited. </span><span style=""font-size: 13px;"">Therefore, the Old English Bulldog had outlived its usefulness in England as a sporting animal and its active or ""working"" days were numbered. However, emigrants did have a use for such dogs in the New World. In mid-17th century New York, Bulldogs were used as a part of a citywide roundup effort led by Governor </span><span style=""font-size: small;"">Richard Nicolls</span><span style=""font-size: 13px;"">. Because cornering and leading wild bulls was dangerous, Bulldogs were trained to seize a bull by its nose long enough for a rope to be secured around its neck. Bulldogs as pets were continually promoted by dog dealer </span><span style=""font-size: small;"">Bill George</span><span style=""font-size: 13px;"">.</span> Despite slow maturation so that growing up is rarely achieved by two and a half years, bulldogs' lives are relatively short. At five to six years of age they are starting to show signs of aging. In time, the original old English Bulldog was crossed with the pug. The outcome was a shorter, wider dog with a brachycephalic skull. Though today's Bulldog looks tough, he cannot perform the job he was originally created for as he cannot withstand the rigors of running and being thrown by a bull, and also cannot grip with such a short muzzle. The oldest single breed specialty club is The Bulldog Club (England), which was formed in 1878. Members of this club met frequently at the Blue Post pub on Oxford Street in London. There they wrote the first standard of perfection for the breed. In 1894 the two top Bulldogs, King Orry and Dockleaf, competed in a contest to see which dog could walk 20 miles. King Orry was reminiscent of the original Bulldogs, lighter boned and very athletic. Dockleaf was smaller and heavier set, more like modern Bulldogs. King Orry was declared the winner that year, finishing the 20-mile walk while Dockleaf collapsed.<sup id=""cite_ref-8""> </sup> At the turn of the 20th century, Ch. Rodney Stone became the first Bulldog to command a price of $5,000 when he was bought by controversial Irish American political figure Richard Croker. <h2>Health</h2> A UK survey puts Bulldog life expectancy at 6.5 years, although the UK Bulldog Breed Council puts the average life span at 8?10 years. The leading cause of death of Bulldogs in the survey was cardiac related (20%), cancer (18%), and old age (9%). Those that died of old age had an average lifespan of 10 to 11 years.<sup id=""cite_ref-10""> </sup> Statistics from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals indicate that of the 467 Bulldogs tested between 1979 and 2009 (30 years), 73.9% were affected by hip dysplasia, the highest amongst all breeds. Similarly, the breed has the worst score in the British Veterinary Association/Kennel Club Hip Dysplasia scoring scheme, although only 22 Bulldogs were tested in the scheme. Patellar luxation is another condition; it affects 6.2% of Bulldogs.<sup id=""cite_ref-13""> </sup> Some individuals of this breed are prone to interdigital cysts?cysts that form between the toes. These cause the dog some discomfort, but are treatable either by vet or an experienced owner. They may also suffer from respiratory problems. Other problems can include cherry eye, a protrusion of the inner eyelid (which can be corrected by a veterinarian), allergies, and hip issues in older Bulldogs. Over 80% of Bulldog litters are delivered by Caesarean section because their characteristically large heads can become lodged in the mother's birth canal. The folds, or ""rope,"" on a Bulldog's face should be cleaned daily to avoid infections caused by moisture accumulation. Some Bulldogs' naturally curling tails can be so tight to the body as to require regular cleaning and ointment. Like all dogs, Bulldogs require daily exercise. If not properly exercised it is possible for a Bulldog to become overweight, which could lead to heart and lung problems, as well as stress on the joints. It has been said that bulldogs are ""the most relentless farters in the canine world.""<sup id=""cite_ref-15""> </sup> Bulldogs have very small nasal cavities and thus have great difficulty keeping their bodies cool. Bulldogs are very sensitive to heat. Extra caution should be practiced in warmer climates and during summer months. Bulldogs must be given plenty of shade and water, and must be kept out of standing heat. Air conditioning and good ventilation are required to keep them healthy and safe. Bulldogs actually do most of their sweating through the pads on their feet and accordingly enjoy cool floors. Like all brachycephalic, or ""short faced,"" breeds, Bulldogs can easily become overheated and even die from hyperthermia. (see Brachycephalic syndrome) They can be big snorters and heavy breathers, and they tend to be loud snorers. Bulldog owners can keep these issues under control by staying aware and protecting their Bulldog(s) from these unsafe conditions. In January 2009, after the BBC documentary <i>Pedigree Dogs Exposed</i>, The Kennel Clubintroduced revised breed standards for the British Bulldog, along with 209 other breeds, to address health concerns. Opposed by the British Bulldog Breed Council, it was speculated by the press that the changes would lead to a smaller head, fewer skin folds, a longer muzzle, and a taller thinner posture, in order to combat problems with respiration and breeding due to head size and width of shoulders.<sup id=""cite_ref-Time14Jan09Bulldog_16-0""> </sup> [button link=""http://alphamatch.com/listings/?pet-type=1081&amp;breed-2=2566"" color=""black"" type=""big-button"" type=""Search for Bulldog""]Search for Bulldog[/button]",NULL,NULL,NULL,"Y","0"

It has a solid build and a short muzzle. The bullmastiff shares the characteristics of Molosser dogs, and was originally developed by 19th-century gamekeepers to guard estates. The breed's bloodlines are drawn from the English Mastiff and Old English Bulldog. It was recognized as a purebred dog by the English Kennel Club in 1924. They are a very quiet dog; they very rarely bark.

Females should be 24 to 26 inches (61 to 66 cm) at the withers, and 100 to 120 pounds (45 to 54 kg). Exceeding these dimensions is discouraged by breeders. <h3>Color</h3> A bullmastiff's coat may appear in fawn, red, or brindle. These are the only acceptable colors in the AKC standard. The fawn can range from a very light brown to a reddish brown. Red can range from a light red-fawn to a dark rich red. Brindles are a striped overlay of the fawn or red. A bullmastiff should have no white markings, except for on the chest where a little white is allowed. <h2>History</h2> Bred by English gamekeepers in the 19th century to assist English wardens or gamekeepers guard estates. As a result the bullmastiff is known as the Gamekeeper's Night Dog. The Bullmastiff was a cross of 40% Old English Bulldog (not the short, chubby Bulldog of today) and 60% English Mastiff for its size, strength and loyalty. They bark much less often than other breeds; however, they will bark on alarm. They were also bred to pull things. The bullmastiff was recognized as a pure-bred dog in 1924 by the English Kennel Club. In October, 1933, the American Kennel Club recognized the bullmastiff. The first standard for the breed was approved in 1935. The standard has undergone several revisions since then. The most current version is available on the AKC Web site.<sup id=""cite_ref-3""> </sup> <h2>Trainability</h2> Bullmastiffs are strong, powerful but sensitive dogs. For a bullmastiff to become a well-behaved family member, consistency is needed. Training and socialization is of high importance. Dogs of this breed are natural guardians of their home and owners. No special guard training is needed for a bullmastiff to react appropriately if his family is endangered. Special approach to bullmastiff training is needed, because these dogs do not like to repeat the same actions again and again. Activities bullmastiffs enjoy include obedience, agility, tracking, and carting.<sup id=""cite_ref-autogenerated1_1-1""> </sup> <h2>Health</h2> A UK survey puts the median lifespan of the bullmastiff at 7 to 8 years old. A bullmastiff will not stop growing until it is about three and a half years of age.

The breed is commonly used for hunting and burrowing prey among the cairns. Although the breed had existed since at least 1500, the name Cairn Terrier was a compromise suggestion after the breed was originally brought to official shows in the United Kingdom in 1909 under the name Short-haired Skye terriers. This name was not acceptable to The Kennel Club due to opposition from Skye Terrier breeders, and the name Cairn Terrier was suggested as an alternative. They are usually left-pawed, which has been shown in dogs to correlate to superior performance in tasks related to scent. Cairn Terriers are ratters.

Using scissors or shears can ruin the dog's rugged outer coat after one grooming. Hand stripping involves pulling the old dead hair out by the roots. If done incorrectly this can cause discomfort to the dog, causing it to shy away from future hand stripping. Removing the dead hair in this manner allows new growth to come in. This new growth helps protect the dog from water and dirt. Cairn Terrier ancestors are from Scotland, where the wire coat repels water and keeps the dog dry even in rainy or damp climates. Keeping the Cairn Terrier coat in its original state will prevent possible skin irritations. As dead hair is removed by stripping the coat, new growth comes in and the skin and coat will remain healthy. Clipper-cutting a Cairn might destroy the protective wire coat unique to this breed. It is wise to have a pet examined to rule out heritable skin diseases if a Cairn is obtained from unknown sources (i.e. pet stores, rescues, or puppy mills). <h2>Health</h2> These dogs are generally healthy and live on average about 12 to 17 years. Yet breeders, owners and veterinarians have identified several health problems that are significant for Cairns. Some of these diseases are hereditary while others occur as a result of non-specific factors (i.e. infections, toxins, injuries, or advanced age).

It may have existed in the eastern Mediterranean seaboard for millennia, as referenced in ancient carvings and drawings. There are 2,000 to 3,000 Canaan dogs across the world, mostly in Europe and North America. [button link=""http://alphamatch.com/listings/?pet-type=1081&amp;breed-2=1206"" color=""brown"" type=""big-button"" type=""Search for Canaan Dog""]Search for Canaan Dog[/button] &nbsp; <h2>History</h2> The Canaan dog began in ancient times as a primitive feral in ancient Canaan, where the Canaanites lived, roughly corresponding to the region encompassing modern-day Israel, Palestinian territories, Lebanon, and the western parts of Jordan. This dog is one of the oldest, dating back to biblical times. The caves of Einan and Hayonim are sites in which the oldest remains of dogs have been found (more than 10,000 years ago). In the Bible there are a number of references to roaming dogs and dogs that worked for humans.<sup id=""cite_ref-2""> </sup> In the Sinai Desert, a rock carving, from the first to third century AD, depicts a dog that in size and shape appears to be a Canaan type dog. In Ashkelon, a graveyard was discovered, believed to be Phoenician from the middle of the fifth century BC. It contained 700 dogs, all carefully buried in the same position, on their sides with legs flexed and tail tucked in around the hind legs. According to the archaeologists, there was a strong similarity between these dogs and the ""Bedouin shepherd dogs,"" or the Canaan dog. A sarcophagus dated from the end of the fourth century BC, was found in Sidon lebanon, on which Alexander the Great and the King of Sidon are painted hunting a lion with a hunting dog similar in build to the dogs of Ashkelon, and similar in appearance to the Canaan dog.<sup id=""cite_ref-3"">[3]</sup> They survived this way until the 1930s, when Dr. Rudolphina Menzel came up with the idea to use these intelligent scavenger dogs mainly found in the desert, as guard dogs for the scattered Jewish settlements. Menzel was asked by the Haganah to help them build up a service dog organization (later to become Unit Oketz). She captured and acquired wild and semi-wild Canaan dogs. She worked with semi-free and free-living dogs of a specific type, luring them into her camp and gaining their trust. She also captured litters of puppies, finding them remarkably adaptable to domestication. The first successful adult she called Dugma (meaning example). Dr. Menzel found the dogs highly adaptable, trainable, and easy to domesticate. It took her about six months to capture Dugma, and within a few weeks she was able to take him into town and on buses. She began a breeding program in 1934, providing working dogs for the military and she gave pups to be pets and home guard dogs. She initiated a selective breeding program to produce the breed known today as the Canaan dog. In 1949 Menzel founded The Institute for Orientation and Mobility of the Blind, and in 1953, she started to train Canaan dogs as guide dogs for the blind. Although she was able to train several dogs, she found that the breed was too independent and too small for general guide dog use, although some of her dogs were used successfully by children. Her breeding program was concentrated with the Institute, where a foundation of kennel-raised Canaan dogs was established, carrying the name ""B'nei Habitachon"". She later supplied breeding stock to Shaar Hagai Kennels which continued in the breeding of the Canaan dog. After her death in 1973, Shaar Hagai Kennels, managed by Dr. Dvora Ben Shaul and Myrna Shiboleth, continued the breeding program according to her instructions. In addition, a controlled collection of dogs of the original type was continued, primarily from the Bedouin of the Negev. Collection of wild Canaan dogs has become very difficult. Many of the Canaan dogs living in the open were destroyed by the Israeli government in the fight against rabies. The spread of the human population into areas that were formerly isolated, along with their pet dogs, has resulted in the loss of the natural habitat of the Canaan. Even the majority of Bedouin dogs today, other than those of tribes still living a traditional and isolated life style, are mixed with other breeds, Myrna Shiboleth visits the Negev regularly, looking for good specimens living by the Bedouin camps, that she can breed with her dogs and use to strengthen the gene pool., and in the last few years, several excellent dogs have been found and brought into the breeding group. <h2>Appearance</h2> The Canaan dog is a typical primitive dog in appearance. It is a medium-sized square built dog, with a wedge-shaped head, medium-sized, erect and low set ears with a broad base and rounded tips. Its outer coat is dense, harsh and straight of short to medium-length. The undercoat should be close and profuse according to season. Color ranges from black to cream and all shades of brown and red between, usually with small white markings, or all white with colour patches. Spotting of all kinds is permitted, as well as white or black masks. Rudolphina Menzel, an immigrant to Mandate Palestine from Austria, having studied the desert free living dogs and the variations in appearances, classified these canines into four types: 1) heavy, sheepdog appearance, 2) dingo-like appearance, 3) Border Collie appearance, 4) Greyhound appearance. Menzel concluded that the Canaan dog is a derivative of the Type III pariah ? the collie type (referring to the type of farm collie found in the 1930s which was a medium dog of moderate head type more similar to today's border collie, not the modern rough coated collie). In writing the first official standard for the Canaan dog, Menzel wrote: ""Special importance must be placed on the points that differentiate the Canaan-dog from the German Shepard dog, whose highly bred form he sometimes resembles: the Canaan-dog is square, the loin region short, the forequarters highly erect, the hindquarters less angular, the neck as noble as possible, the tail curled over the back when excited, the trot is short (see also differences in head and color)"".<sup id=""cite_ref-6""> </sup> Type varies somewhat between the lines of other Canaan dogs and those found in Israel and the rest of the world. Canaan dogs have a strong survival instinct. They are quick to react and wary of strangers, and will alert to any disturbances with promptbarking, thus making them excellent watchdogs. Though defensive, they are not aggressive and are very good with children within the family, but may be wary of other children or defensive when your child is playing with another child. They are intelligent and learn quickly, but may get bored with repetitive exercises or ignore commands if they find something of more interest. <h2>Skills</h2> Canaan Dogs can compete in dog agility trials, obedience, showmanship, flyball, tracking, and herding events. Herding instincts and trainability can be measured at noncompetitive herding tests. Canaans exhibiting basic herding instincts can be trained to compete in herding trials.<sup id=""cite_ref-Hartnagle-Taylor_and_Ty_Taylor_7-0""> </sup> <h2>Health</h2> In general, the Canaan dog does not suffer from known hereditary problems. Although the breed is one of the healthiest, George A. Padgett, DVM, listed diseases that have been seen, at one time or another, in the Canaan dog: hypothyroidism, epilepsy, progressive retinal atrophy (PRA), cryptorchidism, hip dysplasia, elbow dysplasia, luxating patella, and osteochondritis dissecans (OCD). <h2>Breed recognition</h2> The Canaan dog was first recognized by the Israel Kennel Club in 1953 and by the FCI (Federation Cynologique Internationale) in 1966. The first accepted standard was written by Dr. Menzel. The Kennel Club in the United Kingdom officially recognized the breed in December 1970. In 1986, the first Canaan dogs were brought to Finland from Sha'ar Hagai Kennel, in Israel. The Canaan Dog is today recognized by all the world's kennel clubs and is being bred in many countries. There are breed clubs in the U.S., Canada, the U.K., Finland, Germany, France, and Israel. <h3>Canada</h3> The first Canaan dog came to Canada May 16, 1970. The dogs came from a kennel in Delaware. The Canadian Canaan Club was formed in 1972, and the first executive of the Club was elected on March 15, 1973. The club has since been dissolved. The Canaan dog obtained entry into the Miscellaneous Class of the Canadian Kennel Club on December 1, 1975. In January 1993, the breed was accepted in the Working Group, as the Canadian Kennel Club did not have a Herding group at that time. <h3>United Kingdom</h3> The first Canaan Dog was brought to the UK from Damascus in 1965, before they were a recognized breed. In December 1970, they were recognized by the Kennel Club, and the breed was placed in the Utility Group. In May 1992 the inaugural meeting of the Canaan Dog Club of the United Kingdom took place. Since 1996 the breed has begun to grow in numbers in the UK, though it is still quite numerically small. <h3>United States</h3> On September 7, 1965, Menzel sent four dogs to Ursula Berkowitz of Oxnard, California, the first Canaan dogs in the United States. The Canaan Dog Club of America was formed the same year, and stud book records were kept from these first reports. In June 1989, the Canaan dog entered the American Kennel Club Miscellaneous Class. Its profile was raised when John F. Kennedy Jr. purchased a Canaan dog in the 1990s. Canaan dogs were registered in the AKC Stud Book as of June 1, 1997. The dogs began competing in conformation on August 12, 1997.

Other names include <i><b>qimmiq</b></i> or <i><b>qimmit </b></i>(Inuit language word for ""dog""). Although once used as the preferred method of transportation by Inuit in the Canadian Arctic, traditional working dog teams became increasingly rare in the North after the 1960s. This is often cited a result of snowmobiles becoming more popular, however it may also be the result of the alleged organized and systematic mass slaughter of Inuit sled dogs in the Eastern Arctic between 1950 and 1970 by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.<sup id=""cite_ref-qtc_7-1""> </sup><sup id=""cite_ref-9""></sup> [button link=""alphamatch.com/listings/?pet-type=1081&amp;breed-2=1954"" color=""black"" type=""big-button"" type=""Canadian Eskimo Dog""]Canadian Eskimo Dog[/button] &nbsp; <h2>Description</h2> <h3>Appearance</h3> The Canadian Eskimo Dog should always be powerfully built, athletic, and imposing in appearance. It should be of ""powerful physique giving the impression that he is not built for speed but rather for hard work."" As is typical of spitz breeds, it has erect, triangular ears, and a heavily feathered tail that is carried over its back. Males should be distinctly more masculine than females, who are finer boned, smaller, and often have a slightly shorter coat. Its superficial similarity to wolves was often noted by explorers during the Coppermine Expedition of 1819?1822. They noted that the ears of the Eskimo dogs they encountered were similar to those of American wolves, and their forelegs lacked the black mark above the wrist characteristic of European wolves. The most sure way to distinguish the two species was said to be through the length and posture of the tail, which was shorter and more curved in the dog.<sup id=""cite_ref-fauna_11-0""> </sup> <h4>Coat and colour</h4> The coat is very thick and dense, with a soft undercoat and stiff, coarse guard hairs. The Eskimo Dog has a mane of thick fur around its neck, which is quite impressive in the males and adds an illusion of additional size. This mane is smaller in females. Eskimo Dogs can be almost any colour, and no one colour or colour pattern should dominate. Solid white dogs are often seen, as well as white dogs with patches of another colour on the head or both body and head. Solid silver or black coloured dogs are common as well. Many of the solid coloured dogs have white mask-like markings on the face, sometimes with spots over the eyes. Others might have white socks and nose stripes with no eye spots or mask. <h4>Size</h4> The size of Canadian Eskimo dogs depends on their sex. Males weigh 30?40 kg (66?88 lb) and stand 58?70 cm (23?28 in) at the shoulder. Females weigh 18?30 kg (40?66 lb) and stand 50?60 cm (20?24 in).<sup id=""cite_ref-NZKC_5-5""> </sup> <h3>Temperament</h3> The Canadian Eskimo Dog's temperament reflects its original work and environment. It is loyal, tough, brave, intelligent, and alert. It is affectionate and gentle, and develops a deep bond with its owner and is intensely loyal. When used as sled dogs, they were often required to forage and hunt for their own food. Consequently, many Canadian Eskimo Dogs have stronger prey drive than some other breeds. Owing to their original environment, they take pure delight in cold weather, often preferring to sleep outside in cold climates. Like most spitz breeds they can be very vocal. <h2>Care and training</h2> Canadian Eskimo Dogs need a very large amount of exercise. They cannot just be walked, they need higher intensity work, requiring more exercise than many dog owners can give. This need for work and stimulation also makes them well suited for dog sports, such as carting, mushing, and skijoring. They are very trainable and submissive, unlike many spitz breeds, as well as intelligent. The Canadian Eskimo Dog is best kept in a cold climate, and is prone to heatstroke. Its coat is fairly easy to care for most times of the year, needing brushing only one or two times a week. However when it sheds (which happens once a year) it will need grooming every day. Historically, Inuit would put their dogs to the harness as soon as they could walk, and would acquire the habit of pulling sledges in their attempts to break free. At the age of two months, the pups would be placed with adult dogs. Sometimes, ten pups would be put under the lead of an older animal, coupled with frequent beatings from their masters, which would educate the pups.<sup id=""cite_ref-fauna_11-1""> </sup> <h2>History</h2> The Canadian Eskimo Dog is known to have been resident in the Arctic for at least 4,000 years. The Canadian Eskimo Dog was first bred by the Thule people, while research has shown that it is related to the Greenland Dog, with very little significant genetic differences. It is sometimes considered the same breed by authorities, although the Greenland Dog can be criticized for lacking any proper breeding program, questioning its validity as a pure breed. Inuit never considered the dog as part of the animal kingdom (<i>uumajuit</i>), but merely as a tool for human existence. It was, and still is (to a very limited extent), used by the Canadian Inuit as multi-purpose dogs, often put to work hunting seals and other Arctic game, and hauling supplies and people. Explorers noted that the dogs were capable of tracking a seal hole from a great distance, and were occasionally used to hunt polar bears. The dogs were reported to be so enthusiastic in hunting bears that, sometimes, their handlers shouted ""<i>nanuq</i>"" (Inuktitut name for the bear) to encourage them when pulling sledges. The dogs however would not pursue wolves, and would howl fearfully at their approach. Frozen dog urine was used by Inuit as a medicine, and their fur was more prized than that of wolves, due to its greater resistance to wear. In times of famine, the dogs would be used as an emergency food source. Though once assumed to be a tamed wolf or wolf-dog hybrid by explorers, including Charles Darwin due to similarities in appearance and vocalisations, genetic testing has shown that the Eskimo dog has no recent wolf ancestry.<sup id=""cite_ref-isdi_3-1""> </sup> <h3>Decline</h3> <div> <div>They are sometimes used for recreational hunting of polar bears inCanada. Use of motorized vehicles, such as snow machines, is more common. By law, a dog team must be used for commercial polar bear hunting in NT and NU.</div> </div> There is some debate surrounding the decline of the breed. Often the introduction of the snowmobile is cited as the main contributing factor. In the 19th century and early 20th century this breed was in demand for polar expeditions. When snowmobiles came into use, the population numbers started rapidly declining, because snowmobiles are faster and need less care. In the 1920s there were approximately 20,000 dogs living in the Canadian Arctic, and the breed had been accepted for showing by both the American Kennel Club (AKC) and the Canadian Kennel Club (CKC); however, in 1959 the AKC dropped the breed from its registry because of extremely low numbers. Inuit communities have gone on record for blaming the breed's decline on mass killings that occurred during the 1950s to 1970s. Many claim that the RCMP and other persons in authority killed Inuit sled dogs systematically and determinedly. It is proposed this was done to disrupt Inuit culture and way of life. Though there is no major consensus, by 1963 there was supposedly only one dog registered with the CKC, and when this dog died there were still no others registered. The decline in dog population and allegations against the RCMP by Inuit is documented in the 2010 National Film Board of Canada film <i>Qimmit: A Clash of Two Truths</i>.<sup id=""cite_ref-qimmit_21-0""> </sup> <h3>Resurgence</h3> The Canadian Eskimo Dog may have gone extinct if not for the Eskimo Dog Research Foundation (EDRF) and Brian Ladoon (The Canadian Eskimo Dog Foundation). The EDRF was founded in 1972 by William Carpenter and John McGrath and was largely funded by theCanadian Government and the Northwest Territories Government, with some support from the CKC. The EDRF purchased dogs from the small (about 200 dogs) population remaining in the Canadian Arctic from remote Inuit camps on Baffin Island, Boothia Peninsula, and Melville Peninsula. The EDRF then began breeding dogs in order to increase numbers. Brian Ladoon also bought dogs in the 70s from the northern communities of Canada and started breeding after being given the mission of saving them by Bishop Omer Alfred Robidoux of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Churchill-Baie d'Hudson. Brian Ladoon switched from Malamutes and Huskies to the CED and after breeding for 30 years still has the largest genetic stock colony of Canadian Eskimo Dogs in the world. The documentary ""The Last Dogs of Winter"" (2011) tells Brian Ladoons story. The modern breed originated from a relatively high number of founders, thus ensuring sufficient genetic variability to avoid the inbreeding that is crippling other dog breeds. Most dog breeds are derived by a very small number of founders (for example just 9 dogs were used as founders during the creation of the Siberian Husky) and therefore inbreeding tends to be high, resulting in a high incidence of illness due to gene mutations.<sup id=""cite_ref-23""> </sup> The Canadian Eskimo Dog is still very rare; however, it is becoming more popular in Arctic tourism, with an increasing number of sled dog teams that entertain tourists. Additionally, commercial polar bear hunts must be conducted by 'traditional' methods in the Northwest Territories and Nunavut, which is by dog team. This is required partly for safety reasons; the working dog can better sense when a polar bear is around, whereas the sound of a snowmobile motor masks any sign of a polar bear. On May 1, 2000, as recorded in the Hansard of the Legislative Assembly of Nunavut, the Canadian territory of Nunavut officially adopted the ""Canadian Inuit Dog"" as the animal symbol of the territory, thus sealing the name of their traditional dog, qimmiq in the Inuktitut language.

Lehr Brisbin. Carolina Dogs are now bred and kept in captive collections or packs, and as pets. A breed standard has been developed by the United Kennel Club that now specifies the appearance of these dogs.<sup id=""cite_ref-1""> </sup> Carolina Dogs were discovered during the 1970s living in isolated stretches of longleaf pines and cypress swamps in the Southeastern United States. Carolina Dogs are a medium sized dog, that comes in varying shades of red ginger, buff, fawn, black, black and tan or piebald with or without small white markings on toes, chest, tail tip and muzzle. Frequently puppies have a melanistic mask that usually fades as the adult coat comes in.

Lehr Brisbin Jr., a Senior Research Ecologist at the University of Georgia's Savannah River Ecology Lab, first came across a Carolina Dog while working at the Savannah River site. Horace, a stray white dog with brown markings, was wandering the site's boundary when he caught Brisbin?s attention. Brisbin, who had seen many rural dogs chained to the back of porches and doghouses, assumed this was just a normal stray. Many of these dogs roamed the woods and would turn up in humane traps, and Brisbin began to wonder how many more of these were in the wild. On a hunch, he went to the pound and was surprised by the resemblance the dog had to dingos.<sup id=""cite_ref-NGN_5-0""> </sup> <h2>Evidence of ancient roots</h2> <h3>Physical</h3> Some ancient paintings and rock art of Native Americans depict dogs that have physical traits similar to those of Carolina Dogs. Carolina Dogs also have a ginger-colored coat that is found on other wild dogs, including Australian Dingoes and Korea?s native dog, the Jindo. Also, fossils of the dogs of Native Americans exhibit similar bone structures to Carolina Dogs. Brisbin found a resemblance between 2,000-year-old skulls and those of the Carolina Dogs, but concluded that there was too large a difference to prove any connection. Along with this, DNA testing has pointed to a link.<sup id=""cite_ref-8""> </sup> Height: 17-24 inches (45?61 cm.) Weight: 30-65 pounds (15?20 kg.) <h3>Behavior</h3> In the 1980s, most Carolina Dogs were moved to captivity for study.<sup> </sup> Female dogs had three estrus cycles in quick succession, which settled into seasonal reproductive cycles when there was an abundance of puppies. Brisbin noted that this was most likely to ensure quick breeding before diseases, like heartworm, take their toll. Some pregnant dogs also dug dens in which to give birth. After they gave birth or while pregnant, the dog would carefully push sand with her snout to cover her excrement. Excellent at locating and catching small mammals e.g. shrews and mice, using a pouncing technique similar to a fox. The dogs also dug ?snout pits?, or hundreds of tiny holes in the dirt that perfectly fit their muzzles during this time. More female dogs dug them than males.<sup id=""cite_ref-9""></sup> In the wild, Carolina Dogs lived in sparsely settled land instead of the highly populated areas stray dogs commonly occupied. When hunting, Carolina Dogs used an effective pack formation. They hunted snakes using a whip-like motion, and preyed on small and medium-sized mammals such as raccoons.<sup id=""cite_ref-10""> </sup> Carolina Dogs were first noted on the Savannah River Site which by design was depopulated and secured of all trespass and traffic for decades beginning in 1950. The Savannah River Site was also one of two sites secluding South Carolina's remnant deer population at the time of the discovery of the Carolina dog.<sup> </sup> <h3>Temperament</h3> American Dingos are natural runners. They have excellent noses that help them hunt wild animals, when in the wild. They need lots of daily exercise and space to run around if you are going to keep them as a pet. They need to be exposed to a lot of social activity from a young age. Once they are trained enough, they said to make excellent family dogs.<sup id=""cite_ref-11""> </sup> <h3>DNA testing</h3> The preliminary DNA testing may provide a link between primitive dogs and Carolina Dogs. Brisbin stated, ?We grabbed them out of the woods based on what they look like, and if they were just dogs their DNA patterns should be well distributed throughout the canine family tree. But they aren't. They're all at the base of the tree, where you would find very primitive dogs.? This wasn?t conclusive, but it did spark interest into more extensive DNA testing.<sup id=""cite_ref-NGN_5-2""> </sup> The ancient Asian origin of the Carolina Dog was confirmed in 2012. Carolina dogs mitochondrial DNA carried mainly haplotypes(37%) that were unique and closest to East Asian dogs. Others were shared with Chinese non-breed dogs or a Japanese breed dog and the rest were non-specific European but universal haplotypes.<sup id=""cite_ref-13""> </sup><sup id=""cite_ref-14""></sup> As a team led by Peter Savolainen, at the Royal Institute of Technology in Sweden, reported in 2013, several dog breeds in the Americas ? among them the Peruvian hairless, the Chihuahua and the Carolina dog ? are without some genetic markers indicative of European origin, suggesting they arrived in an earlier migration from Asia.<sup id=""cite_ref-15""> </sup><sup id=""cite_ref-16""></sup> <h2>Breed recognition and domestication</h2> Carolina Dogs can be registered with the American Rare Breed Association and the United Kennel Club. ARBA includes the breed in its ""Spitz and Primitive Group"", which includes primitives such as the dingo and Canaan Dog. The UKC has classified them as a pariah dog, a class which includes other primitive breeds such as the Basenji of Africa and the Thai Ridgeback. The word <i><b>pariah</b></i> is derived from a Tamil word, first used in English in 1613, to refer to the lowest level of the traditional Indian caste system; in English, it is used to mean ""a social outcast"". The Indian feral dog was considered an outcast as well. The term ""pariah"" when referring to feral or wild dogs of the Indian feral dog type is sometimes replaced with <i><b>primitive</b></i>, in the sense of ""relating to an earliest or original stage or state"" or ""being little evolved from an early ancestral type"".<sup id=""cite_ref-20""> </sup> It is assumed that dogs placed in ""pariah"" or ""primitive"" groups are of an older type than other modern dog breeds.

It is one of the most popular breeds in the United Kingdom. Since 2000, it has grown in popularity in the United States. It is a smaller breed of spaniel, and Cavalier adults are often the same size as adolescent dogs of other spaniel breeds. It has a silky, smooth coat and commonly a smooth undocked tail. The breed standard recognizes four colours: Blenheim, Tricolour (black/white/tan), Black and Tan, and Ruby. The breed is generally friendly, affectionate and good with both children and other animals; however, they require a lot of human interaction. The King Charles changed drastically in the late 17th century, when it was interbred with flat-nosed breeds. Until the 1920s, the Cavalier shared the same history as the smaller King Charles Spaniel. Breeders attempted to recreate what they considered to be the original configuration of the breed, a dog resembling Charles II's King Charles Spaniel of the Restoration. Various health issues affect this particular breed, most notably mitral valve disease, which leads to heart failure. This appears in most Cavaliers at some point in their lives and is the most common cause of death. The breed may also suffer from syringomyelia, in which cavities are formed in the spinal cord, possibly associated with malformation of the skull that reduces the space available for the brain. Cavaliers are also affected by ear problems, a common health problem among spaniels of various types, and they can suffer from such other general maladies as hip dysplasia, which are common across many types of dog breeds.

The duke recorded that they were able to keep up with a trotting horse. His estate was named Blenheim in honour of his victory at the Battle of Blenheim. Because of this influence, the red and white variety of the King Charles Spaniel and thus the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel became known as the Blenheim.<sup id=""cite_ref-moff19_2-0""> </sup> Attempts were made to recreate the original King Charles Spaniel as early as the turn of the 20th century, using the now extinct Toy Trawler Spaniels. These attempts were documented by Judith Blunt-Lytton, 16th Baroness Wentworth, in the book <i>""Toy Dogs and Their Ancestors Including the History And Management of Toy Spaniels, Pekingese, Japanese and Pomeranians""</i> published under the name of the ""Hon. Mrs Neville Lytton"" in 1911.<sup id=""cite_ref-3""> </sup> <h3>Divergence from King Charles Spaniel</h3> In 1926, American Roswell Eldridge offered a dog show class prize of twenty-five pounds each as a prize for the best male and females of ""Blenheim Spaniels of the old type, as shown in pictures of Charles II of England's time, long face, no stop, flat skull, not inclined to be domed, with spot in centre of skull."" The breeders of the era were appalled, although several entered what they considered to be sub-par King Charles Spaniels in the competition. Eldridge died before seeing his plan come to fruition, but several breeders believed in what he said and in 1928 the first Cavalier club was formed. The first standard was created, based on a dog named ""Ann's Son"" owned by Mostyn Walker, and The Kennel Club recognised the breed as ""King Charles Spaniels, Cavalier type"".<sup id=""cite_ref-toycavdiff_4-2""> </sup> World War II caused a drastic setback to the breed, with the vast majority of breeding stock destroyed because of the hardship. For instance, in the Ttiweh Cavalier Kennel, the population of sixty dropped to three during the 1940s. Following the war, just six dogs would be the starting block from which all Cavaliers descend. These dogs were Ann's Son, his litter brother Wizbang Timothy, Carlo of Ttiweh, Duce of Braemore, Kobba of Kuranda and Aristide of Ttiweh. The numbers increased gradually, and in 1945 The Kennel Club first recognised the breed in its own right as the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel.<sup id=""cite_ref-toycavdiff_4-4""> </sup> The history of the breed in America is relatively recent. The first recorded Cavalier living in the United States was brought from the United Kingdom in 1956 by W. Lyon Brown, together with Elizabeth Spalding and other enthusiasts, she founded the Cavalier King Charles Club USA which continues to the present day. In 1994, the American Cavalier King Charles Spaniel Club was created by a group of breeders to apply for recognition by the American Kennel Club. The Cavalier would go on to be recognised in 1997, and the ACKCSC became the parent club for Cavaliers.<sup id=""cite_ref-moff23_8-0""> </sup> <h2>Description</h2> The Cavalier King Charles Spaniel is one of the largest toy breeds. Historically it was a lap dog, and modern day adults can fill a lap easily. Nonetheless, it is small for a spaniel, with fully grown adults comparable in size to adolescents of other larger spaniel breeds. Breed standards state that height of a Cavalier should be between 12 to 13 inches (30 to 33 cm) with a proportionate weight between 10 to 18 pounds (4.5 to 8.2 kg). The tail is usually notdocked, and the Cavalier should have a silky coat of moderate length. Standards state that it should be free from curl, although a slight wave is allowed. Feathering can grow on their ears, feet, legs and tail in adulthood. Standards require this be kept long, with the feathering on the feet a particularly important aspect of the breed's features.<sup id=""cite_ref-co.za_9-1""> </sup> The Cavalier King Charles Spaniel and the English Toy Spaniel can be often confused with each other. In the United Kingdom, the English Toy Spaniel is called the King Charles Spanielwhile in the United States, one of the colours of the Toy Spaniel is known as King Charles. The two breeds share similar history and only diverged from each other about 100 years ago. There are several major differences between the two breeds, with the primary difference being the size. While the Cavalier weighs on average between 10 to 18 pounds (4.5 to 8.2 kg), the King Charles is smaller at 9 to 12 pounds (4.1 to 5.4 kg). In addition their facial features while similar, are different; the Cavalier's ears are set higher and its skull is flat while the King Charles's is domed. Finally the muzzle length of the Cavalier tends to be longer than that of its King Charles cousin.<sup id=""cite_ref-toycavdiff_4-5""> </sup> <h3>Colour</h3> The breed has four recognized colours. Cavaliers which have rich chestnut markings on a pearly white background are known as Blenheim in honour of Blenheim Palace, where John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough, raised the predecessors to the Cavalier breed in this particular colour. In some dogs there is a chestnut spot in the middle of the forehead: this is called the ""blenheim"" spot. The Blenheim spot is also known as the mark of the ""Duchess Thumb Print"", based on the legend that Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough while awaiting news of her husband's safe return from the Battle of Blenheim, pressed the head of an expecting dam with her thumb, resulting in five puppies bearing the lucky mark after news that the battle had been won. Black and Tan are dogs with black bodies with tan highlights, particularly eyebrows, cheeks, legs and beneath the tail. Black and Tan is referred to as ""King Charles"" in the King Charles Spaniel. Ruby Cavaliers should be entirely chestnut all over, although some can have some white in their coats which is considered a fault under American Kennel Club conformation show rules. The fourth colour is known as Tricolour, which is black and white with tan markings on cheeks, inside ears, on eyebrows, inside legs, and on underside of tail. This colour is referred to as ""Prince Charles"" in the King Charles Spaniel.<sup id=""cite_ref-toycavdiff_4-7""> </sup> <h3>Popularity</h3> According to statistics released by The Kennel Club, Cavaliers were the sixth most popular dog in the United Kingdom in 2007 with 11,422 registrations in a single year. Labrador Retrievers were the most popular with 45,079 registrations in that year. Their popularity is on the rise in America; in 1998 they were the 56th most popular breed but in both 2007 and 2008 they were the 25th most popular.<sup id=""cite_ref-15"">[15]</sup>They ranked higher in some individual US cities in the 2008 statistics, being eighth in both Nashville and Minneapolis-St.Paul,<sup id=""cite_ref-topus3_16-0"">[16]</sup> seventh in Boston, Atlanta and Washington D.C., and sixth in both New York City and San Francisco. In 2009, the Cavalier was the fourth most popular breed in Australia with 3,196 registrations behind only Labrador Retrievers, German Shepherd Dogs and Staffordshire Bull Terriers.<sup id=""cite_ref-austop_19-0"">[19]</sup> In addition, there are also national breed clubs in Belgium, Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, South Africa, Spain and Sweden.<sup id=""cite_ref-20""> </sup> <h2>Temperament</h2> The breed is highly affectionate, playful, extremely patient and eager to please. As such, dogs of the breed are good with children and other dogs. Cavaliers are not shy about socialising with much larger dogs. They will adapt quickly to almost any environment, family, and location. Their ability to bond with larger and smaller dogs makes them ideal in houses with more than one breed of dog as long as the other dog is trained. The breed is great<sup>[<i>citation needed</i>]</sup> with people of all ages, from children to seniors, making them a very versatile dog. Cavaliers rank 44th in Stanley Coren's <i>The Intelligence of Dogs</i>, being of average intelligence in working or obedience. Cavaliers are naturally curious and playful, but also enjoy simply cuddling up on a cushion or lap, making them excellent companion or lap dogs for medical patients and the elderly.<sup id=""cite_ref-terrific_22-0""> </sup> Cavaliers are active and sporting. They have an instinct to chase most things that move including vehicles on busy streets, and so most Cavaliers will never become ""street-wise"". As they tend to regard all strangers as friends, members of the breed will usually not make good guard dogs. Spaniels have a strong hunting instinct and may endanger birds and small animals. However, owners have reported that through training their Cavaliers live happily with a variety of small animals including hamsters and gerbils.<sup id=""cite_ref-terrific_22-1""> </sup> <h2>Health</h2> Cavaliers can often suffer from some serious genetic health problems, including early-onset mitral valve disease (MVD), the potentially severely painful syringomyelia (SM), hip dysplasia, luxating patellas, and certain vision and hearing disorders. As today's Cavaliers all descend from only six dogs, any inheritable disease present in at least one of the original founding dogs can be passed on to a significant proportion of future generations. This is known as the founder effect and is the likely cause of the prevalence of MVD in the breed. The health problems shared with this breed include mitral valve disease, luxating patella, and hereditary eye issues such ascataracts and retinal dysplasia.<sup id=""cite_ref-25""><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavalier_King_Charles_Spaniel#cite_note-25""> </a></sup> [button link=""http://alphamatch.com/listings/?pet-type=1081&amp;breed-2=4759"" color=""black"" type=""big-button"" type=""Search for Cavalier King Charles Spaniel""]Search for Cavalier King Charles Spaniel[/button]",NULL,NULL,NULL,"Y","0"

Aboriginal Central Asians as well as mixes still can be found in its countries of origin, such as Kyrgyzstan, Tadzhikistan,Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, Afghanistan, Uzbekistan and surrounding countries. Some serve as livestock guardians, some protect their owners, and some are used for dog fighting, which is a national tradition in many countries of that region. This breed bears a strong genetic similarity to other aboriginal breeds of Livestock Guardian dogs from that region such as Northern Caucasian Volkodav,Kangal dog, and Akbash. Russian biologists and scientists have studied the local dog population since the 18th century. After the Communist revolution, the Soviet government focused on working dog breeds for the Red Army, and imported the best breed representatives to Russia as per military dogs' and guard dogs' requirements. Over the decades, this practice harmed the local population. The introduction of new breeds to the region led to crossbreeding. Eventually, purebred dogs only remained with herders, breed enthusiasts and farms, with a surfeit of crosses elsewhere.<sup id=""cite_ref-7"">[7]</sup>However, the Central Asian Shepherd Dog population is still stable in general, reproducing some true quality dogs praised for working abilities, regardless of country of origin. Trading bloodlines and purchasing unrelated breeding stock between Russia, other ""former USSR republics"" (such as Ukraine, Belarus etc. ) and countries where CAO still at aboriginal stage is a common practice nowadays. This breed comprises numerous breed types. They differ in size, color, head types, and hair types. Central Asians tend to form a social group, consisting of different members bearing different duties; thus puppies with different working qualities are normally born in the same litter. These breed features, as well as different traditional names for the breed, give grounds for complications with breed standard. Most important, purebred Central Asians have unique breed characteristics. Breed-specific dog anatomy includes exclusive features, such as very noticeable extremely flexible joints, false ribs, specific head set, and very strong neck with massive dewlap. Expressive, almost human eyes, revealing inimitable intelligence, finish the portrait. For working qualities, modern Central Asians have been bred into different directions, depending on the demand for specific abilities. Traditional dog fights had always been a national tradition in places of original habitat, but they had never been cruel and destructive as pitbull-type fights. All herders from the same area annually met together, and fought their strongest sheep guardian male dogs to pick the winner. It was about dominance rather than destroying their own kind. Most dogs evaluated each other when met at the field and the weaker or more submissive dog left, taking the loss. Dogs seldom injured each other, inflicting mostly minor scratches within a short period of time. Only true leaders actually had to determine the strongest dog via a real fight; but this was minor, compared to their everyday duties, facing predators and venomous snakes.<sup id=""cite_ref-9""> </sup> They are the most powerful dogs of livestock guardian type dogs, not too much, but slightly more powerful than Caucasian Shepherd, Kangal, Akbash etc. Modern commercial dog fights often differ from traditional as much as livestock guardian dogs differ from fighting dogs. There are different rules, and different breeds involved. Most Central Asians used for modern commercial fights come from fighting lines. The majority of breeders are aware of their dogs? backgrounds, and will tell whether the dog comes from lines used for fighting. One can always expect a high level of aggression toward other dogs from CAOs with a dog fighting background. It is always important to distinguish whether a dog will display aggression only toward strange, unfriendly dogs entering their territory, while establishing and maintaining the usual social relationships with other animals on the premises; or will attack regardless of whether the other dog is a member of the same social group. Promiscuity in aggression toward strangers and friends is highly atypical for the breed. Central Asians are still in demand as livestock guardians, though not nearly as much as they used to be. These dogs, to differing degrees, are protective against human intruders; they are very territorial, safe with children; they love and respect elderly people, protect all small animals from predators, and are very gentle with family members.<sup id=""cite_ref-10""> </sup> Dogs for personal protection or working dogs originated from livestock guardian dogs, selectively bred by Russian breed experts for working abilities. As a result, they excel in obedience, territory protection, and personal protection, and are very intelligent. As such, they make perfect house dogs. They do not need any complicated training to learn basic house rules, and treat the owner with the same great respect with which their ancestors treated the herder. These dogs were introduced to the worldwide sheep breeding community with great success. Guard dogs must be able to work as a team to protect sheep against predators; thus excessively aggressive CAOs, as with any other dogs, cannot be members of the pack, and will not pass this simple test for compliance with the breed origination purpose. Central Asian Shepherd dogs can come from working lines, fighting lines, and livestock guardian lines, and behave accordingly, regardless of the country they come from. Simple pedigree research and conversation with the breeder will reveal what basic instincts one can expect from the dog. Central Asians from pure show lines are very rare, because most registries require working tests prior to breeding.<sup id=""cite_ref-12""> </sup> Selected for centuries for their abilities to destroy predators, and praised for their power and stamina, Central Asians sometimes are called ""Volkodav"", ""The Wolf Crusher"" in Russian. It is very important to select only stable dogs for breeding purposes, and avoid starting protection training of dogs of this breed at early age. [button link=""http://alphamatch.com/listings/?pet-type=1081&amp;breed-2=3262"" color=""black"" type=""big-button"" type=""Search for Central Asian Shepherd Dog""]Search for Central Asian Shepherd Dog[/button] &nbsp; <h2>General appearance</h2> The breed presents a robust dog of greater than average size with great strength and power. They are independent, curious and alert, yet imperturbable. The dog is as long as it is tall at the withers, or slightly longer than its height. The hair is short or moderately long with a heavy undercoat. Its ears are, in practice, cropped very short, and the tail is docked moderately long (except for dogs from countries where cosmetic surgeries for dogs are illegal). Most common colors are black/white; fawn of different shades, from almost white to deep red; brindle. Some have a black mask. The head is very solid, without pronounced stop or sculls. The neck is low set, short, with dewlap. The body is fairly broad, proportionate, muscles rather flat. The ribcage appears very long because of developed false ribs. The legs are straight, with heavy boning and moderate yet defined angulation. Leg bones must be in proportion, and shall never give the impression that any bone is short. The rump is broad. The typical gait is a gallop; however CAO can trot for hours without wearing themselves out.<sup id=""cite_ref-13""> </sup> <h2>Temperament</h2> The Central Asian Shepherd Dog is a protective dog who bonds first to its human caretaker and next with its perceived possessions. Bred to solve problems, it is independent minded, strong, brave and responsible. It is a large but agile dog, sometimes described as a cat in dog's clothing. With its strong guarding and territorial instincts, it is not a breed for the novice owner. Sensitive and smart, the Central Asian Shepherd responds best to someone who can inspire loyalty while also providing strong leadership. Heavy-handed training will backfire with this breed; but respectful, thoughtful training will yield an undyingly devoted companion. <h2>Exercise</h2> The large Central Asian Shepherd Dog may spend a considerable amount of time moving around in its native lands, and this kind of slow but steady exercise is what it likes best. With a job to do and a piece of property to protect, it will find the highest spot and keep an eye on all that happens. <h2>Grooming</h2> Neither the longhaired nor shorthaired coat require a lot of grooming, but the thick undercoat results in heavy seasonal shedding twice a year. <h2>Working requirements and tests</h2> The Central Asian is a working breed of dog, and different breed fanciers organizations issue sets or rules and recommendations important to preserve dogs? abilities to perform certain duties. This includes special tests to determine a dog?s inborn qualities, and training degrees or titles aimed to show what the dog can learn to do. The National Breed Club in Russia developed a temperament test to reveal a dog?s willingness and ability to protect the premises, as well as titles in Obedience (such as OKD), and in Protection (such as ZKS or KS) for dogs in most pedigrees from Russia and other countries of that region. There are several other types of tests and training titles, from simple to extremely complicated. Breed Clubs in European countries seldom have requirements, while common dog sports such as Schutzhund or IPO are not perfectly suitable for a Livestock Guardian dog. Some European Union Countries developed special tests for large breeds of dogs aiming to reveal a dog?s overall stability, such as The Mentality Assessment test in Sweden. Fight tests are common in countries where the breed is still in aboriginal stage, or in the process of formation. Despite adverse reputation of commercial dog fights, fight tests are aimed to reveal a dog?s willingness and ability to fight predators. In countries with highly developed open field sheepherding, major livestock herd losses may be caused by predation from feral dogs and wolf-dog hybrids, and the livestock guardian dogs must be able to protect the sheep from those. The fight tests were established to maintain this important breed trait. And, finally, the real life test for the Central Asian is simply to be a farm dog, or herd protection dog, in any country. Information on Livestock Guardian dogs behavior and specifics can be found at Livestock Guardian Dog Association. <h2>Classification</h2> Aziat is a versatile, universal breed, and fits under different descriptions at a time, what is a reason for different Kennel Clubs to classify Central Asians under different dog breed groups. RKF, FCI recognized Russian Kennel Club, classified Central Asians as a working dog breed, reflecting tremendous results in obedience, protection and military-related training. Modern breeding requirements by leading Kennel Club in Russia include mandatory temperament test and training title, besides show rating. UKC fit them together with other Flock Guardians of similar breeds, matching breed? natural sheep guarding abilities, proven by breeders and farmers in USA. FCI classified them as Molossoid dogs, sometimes described in different languages as Moloss or Molosser type dogs, likewise, reflecting the match by confirmation and common ancestry between CAO and related breeds.

Members of the breed may also be referred to as a <b>Chessie</b>, <b>CBR</b>, or <b>Chesapeake</b>. The breed was developed in the United States Chesapeake Bay area during the 19th century. Historically used by area market hunters to retrieve waterfowl, it is primarily a family pet and hunting companion. They are often known for their love of water and their ability to hunt. It is a medium to large sized dog. The Chesapeake has a thick wavy double coat. They are described as having a bright and happy disposition, courage, willingness to work, alertness, intelligence, and love of water as some of their characteristics. [button link=""http://alphamatch.com/listings/?pet-type=1081&amp;breed-2=4333"" color=""black"" type=""big-button"" type=""Search for Chesapeake Bay Retriever""]Search for Chesapeake Bay Retriever[/button] &nbsp; <h2>Description</h2> <h3>Appearance</h3> Distinctive features include eyes that are very clear, of yellowish or amber hue, hindquarters as high or a trifle higher than the shoulders, and a double-coat that tends to wave on shoulders, neck, back, and loins. The waterproof coat feels slightly oily and is often associated with a slight musky odor. Three basic colors are generally seen in the breed: brown, which includes all shades from a light to a deep dark brown; sedge, which varies from a reddish yellow through a bright red to chestnut shades; and deadgrass in all its shades, varying from a faded tan to a dull straw color. The breed standard states that white may also appear but it must be limited to the breast, belly, toes, or back of the feet. The head is round and broad with a medium stop and muzzle. The lips are thin, and the ears are small and of medium leather. The forelegs should be straight with good bone. The hindquarters are especially strong and the toes webbed since excellent swimming ability is important for the Chesapeake. This breed is also known for its large and powerful chest, used to break apart ice when diving into cold water while duck hunting. <h4>Coat</h4> The coat of the Chesapeake Bay Retriever is given the most consideration of any trait listed on the Positive Scale of Points in the Breed Standard. However the AKC Standard also reads <i>""The question of coat and general type of balance takes precedence over any scoring table which could be drawn up. The Chesapeake should be well proportioned, an animal with a good coat and well balanced in other points being preferable to one excelling in some but weak in others.""</i> The hair on the face and legs should be very short and straight with a tendency to wave, never curl, on the shoulders, neck, back, and loins only and nowhere over 1.5 inches long. Moderate feathering on the rear of the hindquarters and tail is permissible although not longer than 1.75 inches long. The texture of the thick double-coat is important in protecting the dog from cold water and icy conditions. The oil in the harsh outer coat and woolly undercoat resists water, keeping the dog dry and warm. Maintenance of the coat is minimal and mainly consists of brushing with a short-tooth brush once a week. It is difficult to get a Chesapeake Bay Retriever thoroughly wet, but they should be bathed every 3?4 months using a suitably mild shampoo, then dried thoroughly. Brushing or bathing more often can ruin the texture since it strips the protective oil from the coat and may even remove the undercoat.The color of the coat must be similar to the working surroundings. Any color of brown, sedge or deadgrass is acceptable and one color is not preferred over another. The American Chesapeake Club includes a discussion on color: <dl><dd>Three basic colors are generally seen in the breed: Brown which includes all shades from a light cocoa (a silvered brown) to a deep bittersweet chocolate color; sedge which varies from a reddish yellow through a bright red to chestnut shades; deadgrass which takes in all shades of deadgrass, varying from a faded tan to a dull straw color. Historic records show that some of the deadgrass shades can be very light, almost white in appearance, while darker deadgrass colors can include diluted shades of brown called ash, that appear as either gray or taupe. The almost white and ash/taupe/gray shades are not commonly seen, but are acceptable.</dd></dl><dl><dd>The difference between a sedge and a deadgrass is that the deadgrass shades contain no significant amount of red, while the sedge shades do have red. Coat and texture also play a factor in the perception of color. The self-color pattern is preferred by the standard (One color with or without lighter and darker shadings of the same color). You will see dogs with varying degrees of other markings such as: masking on top of the skull, striping effect of light &amp; dark through the body and on legs, distinct &amp; indistinct saddle markings, agouti coloring and tan points. All are acceptable, they are just not preferred.<sup id=""cite_ref-9""> </sup></dd></dl>A white spot on the breast (not extending above the sternum), belly, toes or back of the feet is permissible, but the smaller the spot the better. White beyond these areas and black anywhere on the body is not allowed in the breed standard.<sup id=""cite_ref-The_Complete_Dog_Book_5-1""> </sup> <h3>Temperament</h3> The quintessential Chesapeake Bay Retriever has a bright and happy disposition, intelligence, quite good sense, and an affectionate protective nature. Some can be quite vocal when happy, and some will 'smile' by baring their front teeth in a peculiar grin - this is not a threat but a sign of joy or submissiveness. Chesapeake Bay Retrievers can make excellent family dogs when socialized properly. Some Chesapeakes are assertive and willful and may be reserved with strangers, but others are passive and outgoing with people. Although, Chesapeake Bay Retrievers can be very protective of their owners, so they make a good watch dog for a home. <h4>Training</h4> The Chesapeake Bay Retriever is a versatile breed competing in field trials, hunt tests, conformation, obedience, agility and tracking, yet remains true to its roots as a hunting dog of great stamina and ability. The Chesapeake Bay Retriever is an intelligent breed and learns at a high speed. Historically considered stubborn and difficult to train, many trainers thought this breed required more physical discipline than other retriever breeds. Chesapeakes were bred for an excess of natural hunting ability, rather than train-ability, which leads to the erroneous conclusion that they are stubborn or hard-headed when in actuality they are responding to their instinctive hunting talent.Some trainers now recommend that the Chesapeake Bay Retriever owner use consistent, daily obedience training with play time before and after to keep the dog wanting to work with little or no physical discipline required.<sup id=""cite_ref-11""> </sup> <h2>Health</h2> The breed is subject to a number of hereditary diseases.

Like the Chien de Saint-Hubert it was a scenthound, and formed part of the royal packs of France, which were composed, from about 1250 till 1470, exclusively of hounds of this type. According to King Charles IX, (1550?1574) they supposedly were introduced to France through Saint Louis(i.e. King Louis IX, 1226?1270), who had encountered these hounds while a prisoner during the Crusades, and subsequently received some as a gift. Old writers on hunting liked to ascribe an ancient and remote origin to their hounds, and these were claimed to be originally from Tartary. They were large, and, even though they did not have such good noses, were preferred by the Kings to the St Huberts, which were said to be only of medium size. Jaques du Fouilloux, in the 16th century, says they were common, and describes them as ?gris? (grey) on the back with forequarters and legs tan or red, some having near black hair on the back. They were rough haired, and were ancestors of the modern French rough-coated Griffon breeds. However the rough coats were not mentioned by Charles IX or du Fouilloux, and it has been suggested they were acquired later through interbreeding with indigenous French hounds. They were headstrong, wide casting hounds, inclined to change or overshoot, but determined in their pursuit of a quarry to the death. However, by the nineteenth century, like the St Hubert, they had become virtually impossible to find, because of mixed breeding and the effect of the Revolution on French hunting.<sup id=""cite_ref-VF_5-0""> </sup> George Turberville translated du Fouilloux? book on hunting into English, and used the term ?Dun hound? to translate ?Chien-gris?. We may presume he did not translate it literally as ?grey-hound? to avoid confusion. One finds the term ?dun-hound? in some subsequent writing in English, suggesting that the kind also existed in Britain, and it has been supposed that these ?dun-hounds? went into the make up of the Bloodhound, accounting for the ?badgering? of the hair in the saddles of some bloodhounds. However, Turberville did not make it very clear that his book was a translation, and it is highly possible that people mistakenly believed his work was about English hunting. Early references to the dun-hound may simply come from people relying, like Nicolas Cox, on Turberville, and it is quite possible that the dun hound was never a significant animal in British hunting.

Like most hairless dog breeds, the Chinese crested comes in two varieties, with and without fur, which are born in the same litter: the <b>Powderpuff</b> and the <b>Hairless</b>. [button link=""http://alphamatch.com/listings/?pet-type=1081&amp;breed-2=3533"" color=""black"" type=""big-button"" type=""Search for Chinese Crested Dog""]Search for Chinese Crested Dog[/button] <h2>Description</h2> At first look, the Hairless and Powderpuff varieties of Chinese crested Dogs appear to be two different breeds, but hairlessness is an incomplete dominant trait within a single breed. The Hairless has soft, humanlike skin, as well as tufts of fur on its paws (""socks"") and tail (""plume"") and long, flowing hair on its head (""crest""). In addition to being an incomplete dominant gene, the ""hairless"" gene has a prenatal lethal effect when homozygous. Zygotes affected with double hairless genes (1 in 4) never develop into puppies, and are reabsorbed in the womb. All hairless Cresteds are therefore heterozygous. The Hairless variety can vary in amount of body hair. Fur on the muzzle, known as a beard, is not uncommon. A true Hairless often does not have as much furnishings (hair on the head, tail, and paws). The difference between a very hairy Hairless and a Powderpuff is that the Hairless has a single coat with hairless parts on the body, while the Powderpuff has a thick double coat. The skin of the Hairless comes in a variety of colors, ranging from a pale flesh to black. Hairless cresteds often lack a full set of premolar teeth, but this is not considered a fault.<sup id=""cite_ref-4""> </sup> A Powderpuff has a long, soft coat. Both Hairless and Powderpuff varieties can appear in the same litter. The look of the Powderpuff varies according to how it is groomed. When its fur is completely grown out on its face, it strongly resembles a terrier; however, the Powderpuff is usually shaved around the snout as a standard cut. The Powderpuff Chinese Crested is an elegant and graceful dog who makes a loving companion, playful and entertaining. The Puff's coat is long and silky soft. Ears are large and erect. It is a family friendly breed, not aggressive toward children or other animals. They do not make good kennel dogs, since they love the companionship of their family. This breed tends to be on the timid side with strangers if not properly socialized at an early age. Odorless, non-shedding, and hypo-allergenic, these are great dogs for allergy sufferers. They have been described as having ""a supermodel look, with a saint personality."" Powderpuffs are very affectionate, lively, playful, and love to be cuddled. This breed is exceptionally loving and likes to hug &amp; smile. Many are known to be wonderful ""singers."" They are great with children, very forgiving, therefore should not be taken advantage of with rough handling. They are an entertaining companion, intelligent, and very willing to learn. The Powderpuff Chinese Crested have been known to perform well in agility, obedience, and other dog related activities. They can easily be taught to fetch &amp; retrieve. The amount of body hair on the hairless variety varies quite extensively, from the true hairless which has very little or no body hair and furnishings, to what is called a 'hairy hairless', which if left ungroomed often grows a near-full coat of hair. These hairy hairless are not a mix between powderpuffs and hairless Chinese cresteds, but are merely a result of a weaker expression of the variable Hairless gene. The mutation responsible for the hairless trait was identified in 2008. Hairless Chinese crested dogs are often successful in 'ugly dog competitions' because of their bizarre appearance.<sup id=""cite_ref-6""> </sup> <h2>Care</h2> Both varieties require certain amounts of grooming. The Powderpuff is entirely covered with a double, very soft, straight coat. Although a Puff's coat does not continuously grow, it can grow to be quite long at full length. A weekly bath &amp; frequent brushing will help prevent matting. For an optimal coat, never brush when dry or dirty. A light spray of water, or grooming spray to their coat is recommended before brushing. Many choose to shave their Puff in a ""Pony Cut"" leaving long hair on bottom of legs, tail, head and crest for an easy care coat. Puff's are very clean and have no odor. This breed has ""little to no shedding"". (see Moult). Maintenance of the Hairless variety's skin is similar to maintaining human skin and as such it can be susceptible to acne, dryness, and sunburn. Hypoallergenic or oil-free moisturizing cream can keep the skin from becoming too dry when applied every other day or after bathing. Burning can occur in regions that are subject to strong UV radiation, especially in lighter-skinned dogs. Many owners apply baby sunscreen to their pets before spending time in strong sun. Some Cresteds have skin allergies to Lanolin, so be cautious when using any products that contain it. Unless the dog is a ""True"" Hairless (one with virtually no hair growth on non-extremities), trimming and/or shaving is often performed to remove excess hair growth. The Chinese crested is further distinguished by its <i>hare foot</i>, (having more elongated toes) as opposed to the <i>cat foot</i> common to most other dogs. Because of this the quicks of Cresteds run deeper into their nails, so care must be taken not to trim the nails too short to avoid pain and bleeding. Powderpuffs enjoy getting outdoors for daily exercise, although they are not a high energy breed. They are great for apartment or city living, but being very versatile, also love country living and long hikes. Being a very intelligent breed, this dog does well in obedience type sports. Consistency is a must, however this breed can be relatively sensitive and should have a gentle trainer. The Powderpuff is great at learning and performing tricks.. <h2>Health</h2> <div style=""display: inline !important;""></div> <div>A Chinese crested participating in an agility competition</div> The Powderpuff is not affected by many of the congenital diseases found in other toy breeds. They are, however, prone to some of these conditions listed. Eye problems such as lens luxation, glaucoma, and PRA (Progressive Retinal Atrophy), luxating patellas, and Legg-Pethes disease. The Powderpuff should have full dentition, not missing or crooked teeth, as is accepted in their sibling the Hairless variety. Cresteds have what is called a ""primitive mouth."" This means that most of their teeth are pointy, like their canines. Hairless varieties of the Cresteds can be prone to poor dentition. Poor dentition may include missing or crowded teeth and teeth prone to decay when not properly cared for. Most dogs of the Puff variety have few, if any, dental defects. Eyes are a concern within the breed, with many suffering from a painful and blinding inherited eye disease called Primary Lens Luxation. (PLL) The Chinese Crested can also have at least two forms of progressive retinal atrophy (PRA) which can eventually lead to blindness as well. For PLL and also one of the forms of PRA, there exists a genetic test, to determine if a dog is a ""carrier, clear, or affected."" prcd-PRA. Since the test for prcd-PRA can only reveal the existence of affected or carrier status of this one form of PRA, breeders and owners of the breed should still have regular eye exams by veterinary ophthalmologists. The breed also suffers from another eye disease called Keratoconjunctivitis sicca or dry eye syndrome (DES).<sup id=""cite_ref-9""> </sup> Along with Kerry Blue Terriers, Cresteds can develop canine multiple system degeneration (CMSD) also called progressive neuronal abiotrophy (PNA) in Kerry Blue Terriers. This is a progressive movement disorder that begins with cerebellar ataxia between 10 and 14 weeks of age. After 6 months of age, affected dogs develop difficulty initiating movements and fall frequently. The gene responsible has been mapped to canine chromosome 1.<sup id=""cite_ref-10""> </sup> As with all other toy breeds, the Cresteds can be prone to patellar luxation. This inheritable condition is caused by shallow knee joints (stifles) and results in kneecaps that pop out of place. Its onset is often at a young age, and can cause temporary to permanent lameness based on the severity. Breeders should have their stock certified free of patellar luxation. Many countries' kennel clubs maintain a centralised registry for health results.<sup id=""cite_ref-11""> </sup><sup id=""cite_ref-12""></sup> Allergy and autoimmune diseases have been observed in the breed. The severity of these ailments, which can lead to the premature death of the dog, means this is something breeders need to take seriously in order to avoid it becoming a problem for the breed.<sup id=""cite_ref-13""> </sup> Lifespan 12? 14 years - although many have been known to live much longer Weight 7-12 lbs.

Originating in the 1800s,<sup id=""cite_ref-NZKC_1-0"">[1]</sup> it is now well known through the works of authorAlbert Payson Terhune, and through the <i>Lassie</i> novel, movies, and television shows. There is also a smooth-coated variety; some breed organisations, including both the American and the Canadian Kennnel Clubs, consider the smooth-coat and rough-coat dogs to be variations of the same breed. Rough Collies generally come in shades of sable, merles, and tri-coloured. This breed is very similar to the smaller Shetland Sheepdog which is partly descended from the Rough Collie. [button link=""http://alphamatch.com/listings/?pet-type=1081&amp;breed-2=1932"" color=""black"" type=""big-button"" type=""Search for Collie (Rough)""]Search for Collie (Rough)[/button] <h2>History</h2> Both Rough and Smooth collies are descended from a localised variety of herding dog originating in Scotland and Wales. The Scottish variety was a large, strong, aggressive dog, bred to herd highland sheep. The Welsh variety was small and nimble, domesticated and friendly, and also herded goats. When the English saw these dogs at the Birmingham market, they interbred them with their own variety of sheepdogs producing a mixture of short and long haired varieties. After the industrial revolution, dog ownership became fashionable, and these early collies were believed to have been crossed with the Borzoi (Russian Wolfhound) to get a more ""noble"" head, which is today one of the true characteristics of the Rough Collie.It is not known conclusively if the Borzoi cross made it into the mainstream of the breed. When Queen Victoria acquired a Rough Collie, after seeing one at Balmoral Castle, they were transformed into something of a fashion item. Continued breeding for show purposes drastically changed the appearance of the dogs; in the 1960s, it was a much taller dog than it is today (in the UK; in the US, the size standard has not been revised downward and dogs have remained between 24-26""). Earlier dogs were also more sturdy in build and reportedly capable of covering up to 100 miles in one day. In the UK the Rough Collie is no longer used for serious herding, having been replaced by the Border Collie. Though in the United States and a number of European countries, there has been a resurgence in the use of the Collie as a working and performance dog.<sup id=""cite_ref-4""> </sup> The Collie Club of America is one of the oldest breed-specific clubs in existence in the United States (founded in 1886). The Collie Club in England dates from 1881.<sup id=""cite_ref-Wharton_2-2""> </sup> Quoted from Collie Club of America: <blockquote>Unfortunately, the Collie's exact origins are shrouded in obscurity. It has been the subject of much research and speculation. The word ""Collie"" is as obscure as the breed itself. The name has been spelled many different ways: Coll, Colley, Coally and Coaly. Generally, the most accepted origin of the word is ""Coll"" - the Anglo-Saxon word for ""black"". In the 18th century, the Rough Collie's natural home was in the highlands of Scotland, where he had been used for centuries as a sheepdog. The dogs were bred with great care in order to assist their masters in the herding and guarding of their flock. Without a doubt, it is to the English fancy of the late 1800s that the breed owes its development as a popular show dog. Rough Collies were first exhibited in 1860 at the Birmingham, England dog show, in the generic class ""Scotch Sheep-Dogs"". In 1879 the first English Rough Collie was imported to this country. It is from England that we find the famous pillars of the breed, from which the American fanciers sought not only their next big winner, but also their foundation stock. By the turn of the century, the American Rough Collie was in a state of continued development. The breed continued to flourish in England. American show prizes were dominated by the British imports. As a result of the imports, the breed made rapid progress between 1900 to 1920. These dogs built the foundations upon which the present day Rough Collie is based and paved the way for the emergence of the great American kennels of the 1920s and 1930s</blockquote> The word may trace to Gaelic or/and Irish - in which the words for ""doggie"" are, respectively, <i>c",NULL,NULL,NULL,"Y","0"

The chief differences between the Rajapalayam and the Combai breeds are that the Combai has more powerful jaws, often with a black mouth, much more pendent ears, a more savage temper, and a tendency to be much more active than the rajapalayam. It is also slightly shorter than the Rajapalayam, but appears heavier because of its powerful build. Their coats are easily maintainable, and are less prone to skin disorders, fungal and yeast infections, and parasite infestation. The breed, having evolved naturally many centuries ago, is more immune to most diseases compared to the human-designed breeds. <h3>Temperament</h3> As a guard dog, the Combai is superior to the Rajapalayam. The Combai were used for hunting and keeping watch. Nowadays, these are mostly used as guard dogs in farm houses. Years ago they were used to guard people's cattle from tigers and leopards. A Combai is as intelligent and sensible a family dog as a German Shepherd, and as ferocious as a Rottweiler to intruders. It is an athletic and intelligent breed. Contrary to the popular belief of its savage temper, the Combai is very alert, a good family dog, loves to play with children and enjoys human companionship. It clearly senses who is welcome and not. As an intelligent dog, the Combai strives to please its master and generally responds to the mood and command of its master from its infancy. It is difficult to find a purebred Combai now-a-days, as the importance of this dog has diminished. In demanding circumstances, they can fight intruders (whether humans or animals) until death. <h2>History</h2> The Combai is a very ancient breed of dog, used in hunting as early as the 9th century B.C., when the Maravar kings held sway overSouth India. The Combai was used for hunting boar, bison and deer. Once available in large numbers throughout Southern India, the Combai is now restricted to certain parts of Tamil Nadu and to some special kennels.The original old bloodline Combai has become even very rare. It is often mistaken as a combination of other breeds because of its gigantic appearance when compared with the combai which is available with the breeders.",NULL,NULL,NULL,"Y","0"

When full grown, its weight normally ranges between 35 and 70 pounds (16 and 32 kg) and it stands from 19 to 24 inches (48 to 61 cm) tall, with males usually slightly larger than females. The body is as long from forechest to buttocks as it is tall at the withers, and the shoulders are laid back. The Dalmatian's feet are round with well-arched toes, and the nails are usually white or the same colour as the dog's spots. The thin ears taper towards the tip and are set fairly high and close to the head. Eye color varies between brown, amber, or blue, with some dogs having one blue eye and one brown eye, or other combinations.<sup id=""cite_ref-Thornton.2C_Kim_Campbell_2004_2-0""> </sup> <h3>Coat</h3> Dalmatian puppies are born with plain white coats and their first spots usually appear within three weeks after birth. After about a month, they have most of their spots, although they continue to develop throughout life at a much slower rate. Spots usually range in size from 30 to 60 mm, and are most commonly black or brown (liver) on a white background. Other, more rare colors, include blue (a blue-grayish color), brindle, mosaic, tricolored (with tan spotting on the eyebrows, cheeks, legs, and chest), and orange or lemon (dark to pale yellow). Patches of color appear anywhere on the body, mostly on the head or ears, and usually consist of a solid color.<sup><i> </i></sup> The Dalmatian coat is usually short, fine, and dense, although smooth-coated Dalmatians occasionally produce long-coated offspring, which shed less often. They shed considerably year-round. The short, stiff hairs often weave into carpet, clothing, upholstery and nearly any other kind of fabric and can be difficult to remove. Weekly grooming with a hound mitt or curry can lessen the amount of hair Dalmatians shed, although nothing can completely prevent shedding. Due to the minimal amount of oil in their coats, Dalmatians lack a ""dog"" smell and stay fairly clean.<sup id=""cite_ref-Thornton.2C_Kim_Campbell_2004_2-1""> </sup> <h3>Uses</h3> The Dalmatian is often used as a rescue dog, guardian, athletic partner, most often an active family member, and can be used as a fire dog .<sup id=""cite_ref-3""> </sup> <h3>Litter size</h3> Dalmatians usually have litters of 9 to 13 pups, but they have been known to have larger litters on occasion, such as a massive eighteen puppy brood born in January 2009 (all were healthy).",NULL,NULL,NULL,"Y","0"

Doberman Pinschers are among the most common of pet breeds, and the breed is well known as an intelligent, alert, and loyal companion dog. Although once commonly used as guard dogs or police dogs, this is less common today.<sup> </sup> In many countries, Doberman Pinschers are often one of the most recognizable breeds, in part because of their actual roles in society, and in part because of media attention. Recent careful breeding has greatly improved the disposition of this breed, and the modern Doberman Pinscher is an energetic and lively breed suitable for companionship and family life. Although many Dobermans have been outdoor dogs, they are best suited to live indoors.

They are compactly built and athletic with endurance and swiftness. The Doberman Pinscher should have a proud, watchful, determined, and obedient temperament. The dog was originally intended as a guard dog, so males should have a masculine, muscular, noble appearance. Females are thinner, but should not be spindly.<sup id=""cite_ref-akc_1-3""> </sup> <h4>Size and proportions</h4> The Doberman is a dog of large size. Although the breed standards vary among kennel and breed clubs, the dog typically stands between 26 to 28 inches, 27.5 being ideal (66 to 72 cm), the female is typically somewhere between 24 to 26 inches, 25.5 being ideal (61 to 68 cm). The Doberman has a square frame: its length should equal its height to the withers, and the length of its head, neck and legs should be in proportion to its body. European lines, particularly those from the former Yugoslavia and former Soviet Union, tend to be larger than those in North America. There are no standards for the weight of the Doberman Pinscher. The ideal dog must have sufficient size for an optimal combination of strength, endurance and agility. The male generally weighs between 75-90.4 lbs. (34 and 45 kg) and the female between 59.5-79.4 pounds (27 and 41 kg). <h4>Color</h4> Two different color genes exist in the Doberman, one for <i>black</i> (B) and one for <i>color dilution</i>(D). There are nine possible combinations of these alleles (BBDD, BBDd BbDD BbDd, BBdd, Bbdd, bbDD, bbDd, bbdd), which result in four different color phenotypes: black, red, blue, and fawn (Isabella). The traditional and most common color occurs when both the color and dilution genes have at least one dominant allele (i.e., BBDD, BBDd, BbDD or BbDd), and is commonly referred to as <i>black</i> or <i>black and rust</i> (also called black and tan). The <i>red</i>, <i>red rust</i>or <i>brown</i> coloration occurs when the black gene has two recessive alleles but the dilution gene has at least one dominant allele (i.e., bbDD, bbDd). ""Blue"" and ""fawn"" are controlled by the color dilution gene. The blue Doberman has the color gene with at least one dominant allele and the dilution gene with both recessive alleles (i.e., BBdd or Bbdd). The fawn (Isabella) coloration is the least common, occurring only when both the color and dilution genes have two recessive alleles (i.e., bbdd). Thus, the blue color is a diluted black, and the fawn color is a diluted red. Expression of the color dilution gene is a disorder called Color Dilution Alopecia. Although not life threatening, these dogs can develop skin problems.<sup id=""cite_ref-dilution_5-0""> </sup> In 1976, a ""white"" Doberman Pinscher was whelped, and was subsequently bred to her son, who was also bred to his litter sisters. This tight inbreeding continued for some time to allow the breeders to ""fix"" the mutation. White dobermans are a cream color with pure white markings and icy blue eyes. Although this is consistent with albinism, the proper characterization of the mutation is currently unknown. The animals are commonly known as tyrosinase-positive albinoids, lacking melanin in oculocutaneous structures, but no known mutation has been identified.",NULL,NULL,NULL,"Y","0"

Black masks were considered an indication of the crossing in of the English Mastiff. As an important indication of purity of the breed, attention was paid to the self colored (pink) nose, lighter eye color (dark amber), and red mask. They were originally bred with huge heads; a pioneer for the breed in Germany, Werner Preugschat once wrote: ""What am I supposed to do with a dog that has a monstrous skull and is at most able to carry it from the food dish to its bed?"" The Dogue de Bordeaux was at one time known to come in two varieties, Dogues and Doguins, the former, the Dogue, being a considerably larger dog than the latter.

It has short fur, and is of any color with white markings (but not all white, which has been linked to deafness.) The breed has the typical drop (hanging) ears of a hound, and a long tail. The maximum height of a Drever is 38 cm (15 ins) at the withers, which is about 15 cm (approx. 6 ins) shorter than a long legged hunting hound with the same size body. The Westphalian Dachsbracke is about 2 cm (less than an inch) shorter than the Drever. <h2>Hunting</h2> Most breeds with similar physical traits are bred for a single purpose, but the Drever has been bred to hunt all sizes of game, both hares and roe deer, and is also used to hunt foxand red deer. The Drever has a lot of stamina, and has become a popular hunting hound for deer hunters in northern Norway, Sweden, and Finland (in Finland drevers are not allowed in deer hunting yet, but it is used for hare and fox hunting). Roe deer are nervous quarry, and the hounds which are used to hunt them must move slowly, especially in areas where heavy snow can be expected in late autumn. This is given as the reason for breeding of a dog with a medium-sized body but short legs. The Drever in Sweden is usually kept as a hunting hound and is not usually found as a pet. <h2>History and recognition</h2> The Drever is a Swedish breed originating with the Westphalian Dachsbracke (a small hound for tracking deer), brought from Germany to Sweden around 1910, and crossbred with other hounds to adjust ""to Swedish terrain and game.""

They were used by shepherds and farmers who needed a versatile dog, a jack-of-all-trades, with few demands and able to adapt to a harsh and meager existence. [button link=""http://alphamatch.com/listing-type/pets/?pet-type=1081&amp;breed-2=1747"" color=""black"" type=""big-button"" type=""Search for Dutch Shepherd Dog""]Search for Dutch Shepherd Dog[/button] &nbsp; <h2>Description</h2> <h3>Appearance</h3> The Dutch Shepherd is a medium-sized, medium weight, well-proportioned, well-muscled dog of powerful, well-balanced structure, with intelligent expression and lively temperament. Depending on the coat the breed is distinguished as short-hair, long-hair, or rough-hair.<sup id=""cite_ref-12""> </sup> <h4>Coat varieties</h4> <b>Short-hair:</b> All over the body, quite hard, close-fitting, not too short coat with woolly undercoat. Ruff, breeches and tail plume are clearly visible. <b>Long-hair:</b> All over the body, long, straight, well fitting, harsh to the touch, without curls or waves and with a woolly undercoat. Distinct ruff and breeches. Tail abundantly coated. Head, ears and feet and also the hind legs below the hocks are short and densely coated. The backsides of the forelegs show a strongly developed coat, shortening in length towards the feet, the so-called feathering. No fringes at the ears. <b>Rough-hair:</b> Dense, harsh tousled coat and a woolly, dense undercoat all over the body except for the head. The coat should be close. Upper- and lower lip should be well-covered with hair, the whiskers and beard, and two well defined, coarse rough eyebrows that are distinct but not exaggerated. Furnishings are not soft. The hair on the skull and on the cheeks is less strongly developed. In profile it seems as if the head has a more square appearance. Strongly developed breeches are desirable. Tail is covered all round with hair. The brindle colour may be less pronounced because of the tousled coat.<sup id=""cite_ref-13""> </sup> <b>Color</b> Brindle. The basic color is golden or silver. Golden can vary from light sand- colored to chestnut red. The brindle is clearly present all over the body, in the ruff, breeches and tail. Too much black is undesirable. A black mask is preferable. Heavy white markings on chest or feet is not desirable.<sup id=""cite_ref-14""> </sup> <h2>Temperament</h2> Dutch Shepherds are loyal, reliable, alert, watchful, active, independent, intelligent, and intuitive. Obedience through modest specialized training and discipline can achieve remarkable results. Gifted with a true shepherding temperament, they work willingly together with their owners and can deal independently with any task they are assigned. They are neither aggressive nor shy.<sup id=""cite_ref-15""> </sup> Dutch Shepherds have a strong character and independence passed down from their herding ancestry. Their owners need to be strong yet fair leaders. Although their character and traits suggests a strong potential for doing police or military work, care should be taken that this breed's seemingly sole purpose is not overlooked for its otherwise well-rounded character.<sup id=""cite_ref-16""> </sup> While there is no perfect dog for everybody, the Dutch Shepherd needs an active working lifestyle and an owner willing to make a commitment of proper socialization and training. Once the bond of trust is developed between the Dutch Shepherd and owner/trainer, their enthusiastic and intuitive nature needs little incentive or command to get them to follow through. <h2>Health</h2> The Dutch Breed Club initiated a hotline in 2008 for reporting health and behavioral problems. Their current statement on health is that the breed has no serious physical or mental hereditary illnesses. However, they still recommend, but do not require, screening for hip dysplasia.<sup id=""cite_ref-19""> </sup> Within the rough-hair population care should be taken to screen for goniodysplasia before breeding. This is a condition where the outflow of fluid from the eye is restricted and under certain circumstances can cause blindness. The link between genetics and goniodysplasia is uncertain. Two dogs who have a risk of goniodysplasia can still have puppies who are not at risk. The Dutch Breed Club regulations requires the testing for GD for rough-hairs.<sup id=""cite_ref-20""> </sup> As with any breed, thoroughly research your prospective breeder before making your final decision. <h2>Grooming</h2> The short-haired variety needs just the occasional combing, with the exception during the shedding period in the spring and fall when a daily thorough brushing is needed. The long-haired variety needs to be groomed about once a week, or more frequently depending on work and environment. The rough-hair variety needs to be thoroughly brushed once a week, and twice a year the dead hair will need to be hand stripped. Over-bathing should be avoided to prevent dry itchy skin. <h2>Activities</h2> The Dutch Shepherd is an active and versatile breed. They compete in dog agility, obedience, Rally obedience, flyball, dock jumping, disc dog, tracking, search and rescue, protection sports such as Schutzhund, French Ring Sport, Mondio Ring and Service Dogs of America. In The Netherlands it is still employed as a herder and the instinct is still strong in the breed. Internationally, the Dutch Shepherd is best known for use in law enforcement under the KNPV program. The Koninklijke Nederlandse Politiehond Vereniging (KNPV), or Royal Dutch Policedog Association, was founded 27 October 1907, as an organization to oversee and test dogs for their suitability for police work. Dutch Shepherds with KNPV titles are sought after candidates throughout the world for police and military use, as well as sport competitors and personal protection dogs. <h2>Registry</h2> <h3>FCI Registered Purebred</h3> The F",NULL,NULL,NULL,"Y","0"

It has moderately long floppy ears set high on the head. Its muzzle is long, broad, and strong, allowing it to retrieve even heavy game. The dog's profile should be straight or strongly Roman nosed; any dished appearance to the profile is incorrect. The eyes are generally brown, with darker eyes being desirable; yellow or ""bird of prey"" eyes are a fault. The tail is commonly docked, although this is now prohibited in some countries. The correct location for docking for GSP is after the caudal vertebrae start to curl, leaving enough tail to let the dog communicate through tail wagging and movement. The docked tail should not be too long or too short but should balance the appearance of the head and body. The GSP tail is carried at a jaunty angle, not curled under. When the GSP is in classic point stance, the tail should be held straight out from the body forming a line with the pointing head and body. Like all German pointers, GSP have webbed feet.They are known for going after water fowl in the water.

Numerous breeds were used in its development, including the black Great Dane, the Bouvier des Flandres, and the Standard Schnauzer. Originally bred to assist on farms by driving livestock to market and guarding the farmer's property, the breed eventually moved into the city, where it worked guarding breweries, butchers' shops, stockyards and factories. It was unknown outside of Bavaria until it became popular as a military dog duringWorld War I and World War II. They have dense, curly fur that protects them from the weather and from vermin. Giant Schnauzers come in two color patterns: Solid black, and a color known as salt and pepper, where white, black, and gray hairs speckle the dog at random. Where legal, they are shown with cropped ears and docked tails. Like other schnauzers, they have a distinct beard and eyebrows. Today, the Giant Schnauzer participates in numerous dog sports, including Schutzhund. It is also used as a police dog.

It was recognised first by the Irish Kennel Clubin 1934 and most recently by the American Kennel Club in 2004. The Glen reportedly came into existence during the reign of Elizabeth I, who hired French and Hessian mercenaries to put down civil unrest in Ireland. After the conflict, many of these soldiers settled in the Wicklow area. They brought with them their low-slung hounds, which they bred with the local terrier stock, eventually resulting in a distinctive breed that became known as the Glen of Imaal Terrier. The Glen was developed for eradicating vermin such as rat, fox, badger, and otter, and also as a general-purpose working dog for herding. Unlike many other terriers, they are ""strong dogs"" rather than ""sounders""?they were bred to work mute to ground, going silently into dens after their quarry, rather than barking to indicate its location. In trials, they are actually disqualified if they sound at the quarry. According to Irish lore, which is repeated in many descriptions of the breed, Glen of Imaal Terriers were also used as turnspit dogs to turn meat over fires for cooking. However, evidence for this is scarce, and engravings of turnspit dogs from the 19th century do not show much resemblance to the modern Glen. The breed almost died out before being revived in the early twentieth century. Today, the Glen of Imaal Terrier is still one of the rarest breeds of dog<sup id=""cite_ref-1"">[1]</sup> (in the US, registered animals number in the hundreds) and the least-known Irish terrier breed.

They were bred as gun dogs to retrieve shot waterfowl such as ducks and upland game birds during hunting and shooting parties, and were named <i>retriever</i> because of their ability to retrieve shot game undamaged. Golden Retrievers have an instinctive love of water, and are easy to train to basic or advanced obedience standards. They are a long-coated breed, with a dense inner coat that provides them with adequate warmth in the outdoors, and an outer coat that lies flat against their bodies and repels water. Golden Retrievers are well suited to residency in suburban or country environments. Although they need substantial outdoor exercise, they should be housed in a fenced area because of their instinctual tendency to roam. The dog sheds copiously, particularly at the change of seasons, and requires fairly regular grooming. The breed is a prominent participant in conformation shows for purebred dogs. The Golden Retrievers' intelligence makes it a versatile breed and allows it to fill a variety of roles ? common ones being guide dog for the blind, hearing dog for the deaf, hunting dog, detection dog, and search and rescue participant. The breed's friendly, gentle temperament means it is unsuited to being a professional guard dog, but its temperament has also made it the third most popular family dog breed (by registration) in the United States, the fifth most popular in Australia, and the eighth most popular in the United Kingdom. Golden Retrievers are rarely choosy eaters, but require ample exercise (of two or more hours a day). The breed is fond of play but also highly trainable; Augie, a Golden Retriever from Texas, holds the world record for the most tennis balls held in the mouth by a dog [button link=""http://alphamatch.com/listing-type/pets/?pet-type=1081&amp;breed-2=1287"" color=""black"" type=""big-button"" type=""Search for Golden Retriever""]Search for Golden Retriever[/button]",NULL,NULL,NULL,"Y","0"

Though graceful in appearance, it has good bone girth and is a rugged/hardy breed. Its large upright ears - a hallmark of the breed - are broad at the base and frame a long and elegant headpiece. The neck is long and lean. It has a unique front assembly with well laid-back shoulders and relatively straight upper arm. Coming in both smooth and wire-coated varieties, their coat is a combination of red and white with the nose, ears, eye rims, and pads of feet being a light tan color. Its eyes are a striking amber color and have an alert and intelligent expression. The Ibizan may range in height, depending on which Standard you follow, from 22 to 29 inches (56 to 74 cm) and weigh from 45 to 65 pounds (20 to 29 kg), males being larger than females. The Ibizan Hound coat can also range from smooth (shown left) to Wire. wire coats are to be hard and can range from 1-3 inches in length. <h3>Temperament</h3> Ibizan Hounds are intelligent, active, and engaging by nature. They rank 53rd in Stanley Coren's The Intelligence of Dogs, being of average working/obedience intelligence, but many Ibizan owners will enjoy giving you a multitude of examples of their problem solving abilities. They are true ""clowns"" of the dog world, delighting in entertaining their people with their antics. Though somewhat independent and stubborn at times, they do take well to training if positive methods are used, but will balk at punitive training methods. They are generally quiet, but will alarm bark if necessary, so they make good watch dogs. They are sensitive hounds, and very good around children and other dogs alike. They generally make good house dogs, but are active and athletic, therefore need a lot of daily exercise. They do not make good kennel dogs. Ibizan hounds are sweet, but they are very stubborn and independent. Ibizan Hounds are ""escapologists"": they are able to jump incredible heights from a stand still, so they need very tall fences. They also have been known to climb, and many can escape from crates, open baby gates and even locks. They have a strong prey drive, therefore they cannot be trusted off leash unless in a safely enclosed area. <h2>Health</h2> The Ibizan Hound is typical of the Hound Group in that it rarely suffers from hereditary illness. Minor health concerns for the breed include seizures and allergies; very rarely, one will see axonal dystrophy, cataract, retinal dysplasia and deafness in the breed. Ibizan Hound owners should have their dogs' eyes tested by a veterinarian before breeding. CERF andBAER testing is recommended for the breed. Ibizan Hounds are sensitive to barbiturate anesthesia, and typically live between 12 and 14 years.",NULL,NULL,NULL,"Y","0"

It is very similar to the German Spitz in appearance but is roughly 1.5-2.5 inches shorter at the withers and weighs around 10-15 Lbs less. The Indian Spitz was one of the most popular dogs in India in the 1980s and the 1990s when India's import rules made it very difficult to import dogs of other breeds. Today, despite being overshadowed by other breeds like Pugs and Lhasa Apso, they dominate and thrive as one of the most economical and yet pleasant pets. The Indian Spitz is often called <b>Pomeranian</b> though the two breeds are much different and the Indian Spitz belongs to the Spitz family along with the Elk-Hound, German Spitz, Samoyed and Finnish Spitz to name a few.

Years of breeding produced the ideal dog suited for the plains of India and capable of withstanding India's sultry climate. These spitzes resembled Samoyeds and German Spitzes but had less thick coats and were smaller in size- ideal for the conditions. <h2>Specs</h2> Not recognized by any major Kennel Club, The Indian Spitz is identified as a separate Indian Breed by the Kennel Club of India. These clubs have been working to establish the Indian Spitz as a separate breed at the other Kennel Clubs across the world. Generally Indian Spitzes are divided into Smaller Indian Spitz/Lesser Indian Spitz (Roughly between 5-7 Kilograms (11-15 Pounds) in Weight &amp; 22-25 cms at the withers (roughly 8<sup>3/4</sup>-10<sup>3/4</sup> Inches at the withers) and the Greater Indian Spitz (Roughly between 12-20 Kilograms (28-45 Pounds) in Weight &amp; 35-45 cms (15-18 Inches) at the Withers). The Indian Spitz is generally Milk White but can also be found in solid colours like Black, Dusky Brown and sometimes (very rarely) - a hybrid of black and white (like the Dalmatian). Otherwise they resemble in every way the German Spitz in appearance- their ears being erect. <h2>Behavior</h2> The Indian Spitz is an extremely bright and active breed of dog. While it is adaptable to living in a small apartment, it can also thrive in a large farmhouse with equal ease. Its diet is also extremely adaptable- and can include anything from Milk, Rice and Yogurt to a diet of Rice and Chicken. This breed is extremely loyal to children and members of its family. The Indian Spitz is a superb watchdog and strangers will be greeted with yapping shrill barks. With other dog breeds, the Indian Spitz is rarely hostile and is usually very flexible.",NULL,NULL,NULL,"Y","0"

As with all the setters and the Pointer, it is classified as a gundog in the UK and is included in the sporting group in America and Canada. It is virtually identical in use and temperament to the related Irish Setter and its other setter cousins, the Gordon and English setters, but is more often found as a working gun dog. The original purpose of the breed was to hunt gamebirds. In the UK, their quarry can be partridge or grouse, pheasant, ptarmigan,blackgame, snipe or woodcock as all these birds try to avoid predators by hiding rather than flying away. Overseas bird dogs are used to hunt quail, willow grouse, sand grouse, guinea fowl, sagehen, francolin. Despite the breed's early origins, it almost became extinct until dedicated breeders managed to revive interest and restore the Irish Red and White setter to a viable position. It is still in a vulnerable position but has gained recognition from all major kennel clubs.

It is fast and wide ranging. As it gallops in its quest to seek scent, its head is carried high. Once it locates the birds, it will freeze on point or ""set"" indicating to its handler where the birds are hiding. It may slightly crouch but its position will remain tense, immobile and rigid. The dog's head will remain raised as it savours the airborne scent and it intently stares in the direction of where the birds are hiding. Its tail will be held level with its back.Setters literally show the hunters exactly where the birds are.<sup id=""cite_ref-FOOTNOTEArgue199314_3-0""> </sup> The breed is classified in the gundog group by the Kennel Club in the UK and in the sporting group by the American and Canadian Kennel Clubs.<sup id=""cite_ref-4"">[4]</sup><sup id=""cite_ref-5"">[5]</sup><sup id=""cite_ref-6"">[6]</sup> The F",NULL,NULL,NULL,"Y","0"

It requires frequent brushing to maintain its condition and keep it mat-free. The undercoat is abundant in winter weather, and the top coat is fine. Their coats should also feather in places such as the tail, ears, chest, legs, and body. Irish Setters range in height from 25 to 27 inches (64 to 69 cm), males weigh 60 to 70 lb (27 to 32 kg) and females 53 to 64 lb (24 to 29 kg). The FCI Breed Standard for the Irish Setter stipulates males: 23 to 26.5 inches (58 to 67 cm), females: 21.5 to 24.5 inches (55 to 62 cm). Irish Setters are deep chested dogs with small waists. Irish Setters life expectancy tends to be around 11 to 12 years.<sup id=""cite_ref-2""> </sup> <h3>Temperament</h3> Irish Setters get along well with children, other dogs, and any household pets, and will enthusiastically greet visitors. Even though they do well with household pets, small animals may pose a problem for this breed, as they are a hunting breed. Some Irish setters may have problems with cats in the house, and may be too rambunctious with small children. As the FCI, ANKC and UK Standards state, the breed should be ""Demonstrably affectionate."" As a result, Irish Setters make excellent companion animals and family pets. Irish Setters are an active breed, and require long, daily walks and off-lead running in wide, open spaces. They are, however, a breed with a tendency to 'play deaf,' so careful training on mastering the recall should be undertaken before allowing them off-lead. Irish Setters enjoy having a job to do. Lack of activity will lead to a bored, destructive, or even hyperactive dog. This is not a breed that can be left alone in the backyard for long periods of time, nor should they be. Irish Setters thrive on constant human companionship. Irish Setters respond swiftly to positive training and are highly intelligent. Though they are usually alert to their surroundings, Irish Setters are not well-suited as guard dogs, as they are not a naturally assertive breed. Irish Setters are also widely used as therapy dogs in schools and hospitals. Therapy dogs are permitted in hospitals with special permission and can visit patients on the assigned floors. This is a venue where the therapy dogs are permitted in schools and then asked to sit with children as the students read to the Irish Setter. This process helps to enable the student the ability to read without being corrected or judged. Generally the Irish Setter will lie on the floor with the student as the student continues to read, in this calming and relaxed setting. <span style=""font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5em;""> </span>",NULL,NULL,NULL,"Y","0"

The Irish Terrier is considered one of the oldest terrier breeds. The Dublin dog show in 1873 was the first to provide a separate class for Irish Terriers. By the 1880s, Irish Terriers were the fourth most popular breed in Ireland and Britain. The Irish Terrier is an active and compactly sized dog that is suited for life in both rural and city environments. Its harsh red coat protects it from all kinds of weather. [button link=""http://alphamatch.com/listing-type/pets/?pet-type=1081&amp;breed-2=3172"" color=""black"" type=""big-button"" type=""Search for Irish Terrier""]Search for Irish Terrier[/button] &nbsp; <h2>Description</h2> <h3>Appearance</h3> Breed standards describe the ideal Irish Terrier as being racy, red and rectangular. Racy: an Irish Terrier should appear powerful without being sturdy or heavy. Rectangular: the outline of the Irish Terrier differs markedly from those of other terriers. The Irish Terrier's body is proportionately longer than that of the Fox Terrier, with a tendency toward racy lines but with no lack of substance. The tail is customarily docked soon after birth to approximately two-thirds of the original length. In countries where docking is prohibited, the conformation judges emphasise tail carriage. The tail should start up quite high, but it should not stick straight up or curl over the back or either side of its body. The ears are small and folded forward just above skull level. They are preferably slightly darker than the rest of the coat. <h4>Coat and colour</h4> The Irish Terrier is coloured golden red, red wheaten, or wheaten. Dark red is often mistaken as the only correct colour, possibly because wheaten coats are often of worse quality. As with many other solid-coloured breeds, a small patch of white is allowed on the chest. No white should appear elsewhere. As an Irish Terrier grows older, grey hair may appear here and there. The outer part of the double coat should be straight and wiry in texture, never soft, silky, curly, wavy, or woolly as might be expected in the Kerry Blue Terrier. The coat should lie flat against the skin, and, though having some length, should never be so long as to hide the true shape of the dog. There are longer hairs on the legs, but never so much as a Wire Fox Terrier or Schnauzer. That means you have to have the coat trimmed often which can be expensive. The inner part of the coat, called the under-wool or undercoat, should also be red. The under-wool may be hard for the inexperienced eye to see. Coat should be quite dense and so that ""when parted with the fingers the skin is hardly visible"".<sup id=""cite_ref-1""> </sup> A properly trimmed Irish Terrier should have some ""furnishings"" on legs and head. The slightly longer hair on the front legs should form even pillars, while the rear legs should only have some longer hair and not be trimmed too close to the skin. The chin is accentuated with a small beard. The beard should not be as profuse as that of a Schnauzer. The eyes should be dark brown and quite small with a ""fiery"" expression. The eyes are topped with well-groomed eyebrows. The whole head should have good pigmentation. <h4>Size</h4> Most countries have breed descriptions that say that the Irish Terrier should not be more than 48 cm measured at the withers. However, it is not unusual to see bitches that are 50 cm tall or dogs that are even 53 cm (20 in). Younger generations are closer to the ideal, but there is a downside to this: when an Irish Terrier is very small and light-boned, it loses the correct racy type. Very seldom does one see Irish Terriers that weigh only 11 to 12 kg (25?27 lb), as the original Kennel Club breed description states. 13 kg for a female dog and 15 for a male dog are acceptable. <h3>Temperament</h3> Irish Terriers are active dogs and need and enjoy consistent mental and physical challenges; well-trained Irish Terriers may do well at a variety of dog sports, such as dog agility. The Irish Terrier is full of life, but not hyperactive; it should be able to relax inside the house and be roused to full activity level quickly. Irish Terriers are good with people. They have a highly developed sense of loyalty and it is important that they have a strong responsible leader, for whom they have natural respect. Most Irish Terriers love children and tolerate rough-housing to a certain extent. Irish terriers need exercise; do not get one if you are not prepared to walk it. They enjoy training, new tasks are easily mastered with food and toys working equally well as motivation. Irish terriers have less of an eagerness to please people than some other breeds but have mental ability and enjoy puzzle solving. They respond best to consistent, reward based training from a relaxed, authoritative person. As with all dog breeds, violence should never be used ? instead use distraction and reward the behaviour you want. It is always best to outwit and lure. When seeking a trainer, one should look for a person who has experience with terriers. Irish Terriers are often dominant with other dogs. As with any dog, poorly socialised individuals can start fights and early socialisation is a necessity. Most have strong guarding instincts and when these instincts are controlled, make excellent alarming watchdogs. There are more people joining organised dog sports with their terriers. The obedience training required at a certain level in most dog sports is fairly easy, though the precision and long-lasting drive needed in the higher levels may be hard to achieve. Many Irish Terriers excel in dog agility, even though it may be hard to balance the speed, independence and precision needed in the higher levels. To date there is one Agility Champion in the US, and a handful of Finnish and Swedish Irish terriers compete at the most difficult classes. Irish Terriers have a good nose and can learn to track either animal or human scent. Many Irish Terriers enjoy Lure Coursing, although they are not eligible for competition like sight hounds are. In Finland one Irish Terrier is a qualified Rescue Dog specialising at Sea Rescue.",NULL,NULL,NULL,"Y","0"

IWS have several distinguishing characteristics which place them among the more unique of all breeds: The topknot of long, loose curls growing down from the head which often covers the eyes; a ""beard"" growing at the back of the throat often accompanied by ""sideburns""; and a curled, liver (""puce"")-coloured coat. The most distinguishing characteristic of these dogs is the smooth ""rat tail"", completely free of long coat except at the base where it is covered for 2?3 inches with curls. The face is entirely smooth-coated and, unlike the poodle, should require little or no trimming to stay that way. An IWS is ruggedly built with webbed feet to aid in its powerful swimming. Altogether, the IWS presents a picture of a smart, upstanding, strongly built but not leggy dog, combining great intelligence and rugged endurance with a bold, dashing eagerness of temperament. They are the largest of the Spaniel group. Dogs range in height from 22 to 24 inches (56?61 cm), and weigh 55 to 65 pounds (25?30 kg). As their name would imply these dogs love water. <h3>Temperament</h3> Like most dogs of the AKC Sporting group, the Irish Water Spaniel is essentially an active, willing and energetic companion. Because it has been bred from stock used to fetch game and return it to hand without a fuss, it has the natural instinct of wanting to please. Its keen sense of working as a team makes it a relatively easy dog to train and discipline. Because of its great intelligence and quizzical nature, it has the reputation of being the clown of the spaniel family and will do ordinary things in extraordinary ways to achieve that which is asked of it. Some individual dogs can be very wary of strangers and not every IWS can be trusted to get along with other pets. Early socialisation and training is a must. <h2>History</h2> Although the current breed stock is Irish, the origin of the breed, The Irish Water Spaniel is a native Irish breed for over 1000 years.

In 1903, the Kennel Club combined four separate toy spaniel breeds under this single title. The other varieties merged into this breed were the Blenheim, Ruby and Prince Charles Spaniels, each of which contributed one of the four colours available in the breed. Thought to have originated in the Far East, toy spaniels were first seen in Europe during the 16th century. They were made famous by their association with King Charles II of England (1630?1685) and have been linked with English royalty since the time of Queen Mary I(1516?1558). Members of the breed have been owned by Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia, Queen Victoria and Queen Elizabeth II. The King Charles Spaniel and the other types of toy spaniels were crossbred with the Pug in the early 19th century to reduce the size of the nose, as was the style of the day. The 20th century saw attempts to restore lines of King Charles Spaniels to the breed of Charles II's time. These included the unsuccessful Toy Trawler Spaniel and the now popular Cavalier King Charles Spaniel. The Cavalier is slightly larger, with a flat head and a longer nose, while the King Charles is smaller, with a domed head and a flat face. Historically the breeds that were merged into the King Charles Spaniel were used for hunting; due to their stature they were not well suited. They have kept their hunting instincts, but do not exhibit high energy and are better suited to being lapdogs. The modern breed is prone to several health problems, including cardiac conditions and a range of eye issues.

On average, it stands 9 to 11 inches (23 to 28 cm) at thewithers, with a small but compact body. The breed has a traditionally docked tail. It has the long pendulous ears typical of a spaniel and its coat comes in four varieties, trait it shares with its offshoot, the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel.<sup id=""cite_ref-palikaengtoy_52-1""> </sup><sup id=""cite_ref-palikacav_54-0""></sup> The four sets of markings reflect the four former breeds from which the modern breed was derived. Black and tan markings are known as ""King Charles"", while ""Prince Charles"" is tricoloured, ""Blenheim"" is red and white, and ""Ruby"" is a single-coloured solid rich red. The ""King Charles"" black and tan markings typically consist of a black coat with mahogany/tan markings on the face, legs and chest and under the tail. The tricoloured ""Prince Charles"" is mostly white with black patches and mahogany/tan markings in similar locations to the ""King Charles"". The ""Blenheim"" has a white coat with red patches, and should have a distinctive red spot in the center of the skull.<sup id=""cite_ref-etsckc_55-0"">[55]</sup><sup id=""cite_ref-kckingcharles_56-0"">[56]</sup> King Charles Spaniels are often mistaken for Cavalier King Charles Spaniels. There are several significant differences between the two breeds, the principal being the size. While the Cavalier weighs on average between 13 to 18 pounds (5.9 to 8.2 kg), the King Charles is smaller at 8 to 14 pounds (3.6 to 6.4 kg). In addition, their facial features, while similar, are distinguishable: the Cavalier's ears are set higher and its skull is flat, while the King Charles' is domed. Finally, the muzzle length of the King Charles tends to be shorter than the typical muzzle on a Cavalier.<sup id=""cite_ref-coile9_41-3""> </sup> The American Kennel Club has two classes, English Toy Spaniel (B/PC) (Blenheim and Prince Charles) and English Toy Spaniel (R/KC), while in the UK, the Kennel Club places the breed in a single class.

Males stand at 29-32 inches tall and 100-150 pounds while females are 25-29 inches tall and 75 to 110 pounds. <h3>Temperament</h3> The King Shepherd is self-confident with a well-balanced personality and healthy nervous system. They should not exhibit any shyness or nervousness. They are extremely intelligent, easy to train and eager and faithful to please their owners. This breed makes a fine sheepherder and working dog. They are also a naturally courageous guard and watchdog, showing courage, strength, and hardiness in their role of protector. They make very nice companions and are friendly to other animals and children. They are a docile obedient breed with an easy gait and plenty of stamina. <h2>Care</h2> King Shepherds are not recommended for apartment life. They do best with at least a large yard. The king shepherd loves strenuous activity, preferably combined with training of some sort, these dogs are very intelligent and crave a good challenge. King Shepherds need to be taken on a brisk, daily, long walk, jog, or a run alongside a bicycle. If under-exercised this breed can be restless, and destructive. <h3>Grooming</h3> The King Shepherd's coat is highly weather-resistant. They should be brushed regularly. They should be bathed when needed. <h2>Origin</h2> Two American dog breeders Shelly Watts-Cross, and David Turkheimer created this large breed from the Shiloh Shepherd <i>(American and European German Shepherd dogs andAlaskan Malamutes</i>), additional American bred German Shepherd dogs and the Great Pyrenees.

It is a popular pet for the Balinese and locally Bali's only official breed and efforts are currently under way to have the dog accepted by the Federation Cynologique Internationale as a recognized breed. It is an evolving breed indigenous to the Kintamani region which evolved from the local Bali street dogs, which are rather a feral random-bredlandrace distinctive to Bali. [button link=""http://alphamatch.com/listing-type/pets/?pet-type=1081&amp;breed-2=87"" color=""black"" type=""big-button"" type=""Search for Kintamani""]Search for Kintamani[/button] &nbsp; <h2>Genetic Evidence</h2> Genetic studies have shown that, despite evidence to the contrary, the Kintamani dog is native to Bali. Thirty-one highly polymorphic short tandem repeat markers from Kintamani dogs, Bali street dogs, Australian dingoes, and nine American Kennel Club (AKC) recognized breeds of northeast Asian or European origin were compared. The Kintamani dog was identical to the Bali street dog at all but three loci. The Bali street dog and Kintamani dog were most closely aligned with the Australian dingo, more distantly related to AKC recognized breeds of Chinese origin, and most distantly related to AKC breeds from western Eurasia. Therefore, the Kintamani dog has evolved from Balinese feral dogs with little loss of genetic diversity. <h2>Characteristics</h2> These results come despite observable facts about the Kintamani Dog that make them more similar to breeds from elsewhere and which set them apart from the average village dog; facts which had lent credence to a local folk belief that the breed originated 600 years ago from a Chinese Chow Chow brought from abroad. The Kintamani looks something like a mix between the Samoyed and a Malamute. They have long hair, a broad face, a flat forehead, and flat cheeks like Chinese dogs such as the Chow Chow and are amenable to life as a pet. Whilst many live much the same kind of life as an average village dog, they dig holes to nest their young and some live in small caves among the boulders around Kintamani. They are locally considered good-looking dogs are more often sought after as good pets. The Kintamani dog is gentle around people, yet retains enough assertive behavior to render it a noteworthy (but not vicious) watchdog.<sup id=""cite_ref-Puja05_1-0""> </sup> The most desired coat color is white with apricot-tipped ears. Breeders often confine the dogs to cold dark caves near the Kintamani volcano, insisting it an essential step in developing the thick white coat. However, other coat colors, such as black, are accepted. Other common fur colors include beige. The withers height of the female Kintamani dog is 40?50 cm, 45?55 cm for the male, about the same as the stature of the Bali street dog. The desired physical traits of the Kintamani dog include erect ears, forwardly curved tail held at the midline, medium to longhaired coat, almond-shaped brown eyes, and black skin pigment. Bali street dogs come in many colors and coat patterns, and they are almost always shorthaired and straight- to curve- tailed. Both still whelp in burrows dug into the earth, a feral dog trait. However, <h3>Temperament</h3> A fiercely independent breed, Kintamanis can be aggressively territorial while at the same tender and affectionate with their own families. While most dog breeds are disinclined to climbing and heights, Kintamanis will climb across roofs and spend parts of the day happily installed sitting or sleeping atop a garden wall. They are light-footed and move freely, smoothly and lithely, and will bark when confronted with an unfamiliar sound or sight. Kintamani dog are very familiar to its owner and family. <h2>History</h2> Genetic studies of the breed have shown that has probably evolved from local Balinese feral dogs, and is distantly related to other Asian breeds. Folklore indicates that the Kintamani began with a Chow Chow around 600 years ago. The Kintamani achieved national recognition as a distinct dog breed in April 2006.<sup> </sup> It is also possible that the Kintamani Dog came with the Javanese invaders from the kingdom of Majapahit in 1343 or with the Javanese refugees of the civil war in the 15th century. But of all the hypotheses, about the origins of the Kintamani Dog, only one is really plausible: that sometime between the 12th and the 16th century a Chinese trader named Lee landed in Singaraja in Northern Bali, bringing with him a Chow Chow dog which bred with the local Balinese feral dogs. Lee later in settled in the Kintamani region and raised his family there. Evidence that the Lee family lived in Kintamani exists in the form of a Chinese temple in which people of the Confucian faith still worship.

The name Komondor derives from Koman-dor, meaning ""Cuman dog"". The breed descends from Tibetan dogs and came from Asia with the Cumans, whose homeland was near the Yellow River. In the late 900s, Mongols began to expand their territories at the expense of the Cumans, forcing them to move westwards. Fleeing from the Mongols, they reached the borders of Hungary in the 1100s.

The Koolie is a working or herding dog which has existed in Australia since the early 19th century when it was bred from imported British working dogs. There is substantial variation in the Koolie population, as Koolies were bred to exhibit different characteristics in different regions. The Koolie Club of Australia defines the breed based on its ability to work rather than on its conformation. However, most Koolie breeders refer to the Koolie as a breed rather than as a type, and assert that it ""breeds true"", with various types or strains. The Koolie is a 'heading dog', one which has a natural instinct to cast out (i.e., circle widely), round sheep and bring them back to their owner. Koolies are known as silent, upright, working dogs. They are used for ?heading? sheep and also for quiet careful work at close quarters at lambing time or for ?shedding? (cutting out) sheep.

This produced a type of dog that caught the attention of several individuals. The most notable was Mrs. Harriet Linn, who acquired several of these dogs in 1965 and later acquired several more from the San Jose kennel in 1969; from then on she began to seriously breed them. In 1972 there was enough interest among owners and breeders to come together and formally recognize this breed. It was at this meeting that they formally decided on calling it a Kyi-Leo. The name comes from the Tibetan and Latin languages. ?Kyi? is the Tibetan word for dog; this acknowledges the Lhasa Apso breed which first came from Tibet. ?Leo? is the Latin word for Lion; this acknowledges the Maltese which is also known as the ?Maltese Lion dog?. Since then the Kyi-Leo breed has slowly spread throughout the United States, and has recently become accepted by the American Rare Breed Association as a legitimate breed. <h2>Description</h2> <h3>Appearance</h3> The Kyi-Leo reaches 8-12 inches in height and 9-14 lb in weight. It has a long silky coat, most commonly black and white but sometimes gold and white, which tends to grow to long lengths (never quite reaching past the floor) if tended properly. Its hair also grows on its face and tail. It has small yet delicate legs that are prone to damage if dropped, but the Kyi-Leo can be very agile and quick. The Kyi-Leo has notable similarities, in body size, shape, and hair, to the Shih Tzu dog breed though the eyes are more human set rather than bulging and they do not have the short-snout face. <h3>Temperament</h3> The Kyi-Leo is generally calm, obedient, quiet, and difficult to provoke. It is usually very playful and active around trusted humans or animals, but tends to stay cautious and alert around strangers. Its acute hearing makes it a decent watchdog. It ideally lives in indoor settings and can be very patient when left alone for long hours at a time. <h2>Health</h2> <ul> <li>Because of its small size, the Kyi-Leo has delicate legs and a delicate spine.

Although the breed's name may be baffling, it is <i>not</i> a mix between a Labrador Retriever and a Husky. The breed is very little known, and there are no breed clubs that currently recognize it. [button link=""http://alphamatch.com/listing-type/pets/?pet-type=1081&amp;breed-2=611"" color=""black"" type=""big-button"" type=""Search for Labrador Husky""]Search for Labrador Husky[/button] &nbsp; <h2>Appearance</h2> The Labrador Husky is a fairly large dog that can weigh between 60 and 100 pounds and can grow to 20 - 28 inches. Thick, double coated fur protects these dogs from the bitterly cold temperatures that come with Labrador's long winters. The husky's head is broad and has a long, narrow muzzle. The chest is wide and heavy boned. The husky's muscular and stout body is a unique physical trait, especially when compared to a Siberian Husky. Coat colors include solid white, solid black, black and white, red and white, and grey and white. There are two rare coat colors that can also be found in this breed: wolf grey and solid grey. Any coat color can appear in any litter; the most common colours are black and white, gray and white, and solid black. This breed has existed for hundreds of years, and has become a unique breed due to its isolation from other northern dog breeds over this time. Labrador Huskies were used for transportation for many years, until the advent of the snowmobile. They are now often kept as loving pets. However, there are Labrador Inuit and Metis who still use them for recreational dog sledding and some even prefer the dog team to a snowmobile. Sled dog racing continues to be a winter pastime in Labrador, with long races similar to the Iditarod still happening today. Today, in isolated communities in northern Labrador, spaying and neutering is extremely expensive and logistically difficult. Dog breeding is therefore largely unmonitored and uncontrolled. This has resulted in a great variety of Labrador Husky mixes. It is unclear how many ""purebred"" Labrador Huskies are left in their region of origin, but many of the mixes retain that distinctive wolf-like facial shape. Of all the northern dog breeds, the Labrador Husky is one of the rarest, with less than an estimated 50-60 purebred Labrador Huskies currently identified in Labrador. As a result, the breed is not well understood by many dog breeders. <h2>Temperament</h2> The Labrador Husky may have a somewhat different temperament from other Northern breeds. The breed can be friendly and not aggressive with strangers and is well behaved if socialized properly. These dogs often do well with children, especially if reared with them. Being with other dogs always makes them happy, because they are bred to work well in a pack. Training is easy and fun because they are an intelligent breed. Unlike the Siberian or Alaskan Husky, the Labrador Husky is not well known. The breed has many wolf-like characteristics owing to its ancestry; however, the Labrador Husky has been a loyal and trusted companion to the Labrador Inuit for centuries. It rarely barks but does tend to howl. Labrador Huskies have a combination of strength, intelligence and stamina, properties that are good for virtually any breed. They are not as fast as their Siberian or Alaskan cousins because they have been bred for endurance and strength. <h2>Health</h2> There are no known ailments specific to this breed; special care has been taken in their breeding and this may be the reason few health problems exist. Any health problems the Labrador Husky may have are common to most other breeds. While the exact life expectancy of these dogs isn?t known, a healthy Labrador Husky should live for approximately 10 to 13 years. <h2>Origin</h2> The Labrador Husky originated in the Labrador portion of the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador. Labrador is the northern and mainland portion of the province. The breed probably arrived in the area with the Inuit people who came to Canada around 1300 AD. Although they were once very closely related to other Northern breeds, such as the Siberian Husky, they became isolated in Labrador and continued to develop on their own. Their history of being bred with wolves does not mean that they are wolf-dogs, nor do they have any recent wolf ancestry. However, they still retain some of their wolf-like physical features. Although they have been isolated, some Labradorian people have introduced the blood of the Alaskan Malamute and later for trainability purposes, the German Shepherd Dog. This has created a larger sled dog that looks strikingly similar to the Siberian Husky, but is much larger and more wolf-like. <h2>Grooming and Living Area</h2> Grooming is something to consider when choosing this breed because of the thick double coat. The Labrador Husky probably needs plenty of brushing as any double coated breed would. This dog sheds continuously, but has a major shed twice a year. During the twice yearly shedding time, these dogs should be brushed every day to remove loose hair. Sometimes baths are necessary to fully clean the coat. Exercise is another thing to consider before getting one of these dogs, especially if you are not an active person or family. This sled dog requires a lot of exercise and a large yard is a good idea. Long walks and ample exercise will go a long way towards keeping this dog calm and non-destructive. Giving the dog some sort of work to do such as agility or flyballwill keep them both exercised and happy. Cold climates are obviously best for this breed. <h2>Rescue</h2> Due to largely uncontrolled breeding in some isolated communities, many Labrador Huskies and Labrador Husky mixes are homeless. Often these street dogs are malnourished and in poor physical condition. Rescued Labrador street dogs tend to be extremely friendly and well mannered. Currently, 3 organizations regularly rescue Labrador Huskies and Labrador Husky mixes: The Happy Valley-Goose Bay SPCA, Heavenly Creatures and Litters 'n Critters.

Even-tempered and well-behaved around young children and the elderly. Labradors are athletic, playful, and the most popular breed of dog by registered ownership in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States (since 1991).<sup id=""cite_ref-5""> </sup> A favourite assistance dog breed in these and other countries, Labradors are frequently trained to aid people who are blind and people with autism, act as therapy dogs, and perform screening and detection work for law enforcement and other official agencies. They are prized as sporting and waterfowl hunting dogs. A few kennels breeding these grew up in England; at the same time a combination of sheep protection policy (Newfoundland) and rabies quarantine (England) led to their gradual demise in their country of origin.<sup id=""cite_ref-lorken_7-0""> </sup> The first and second Earls of Malmesbury, who bred for duck shooting on his estate, and the 5th and 6th Dukes of Buccleuch, and youngest son Lord George William Montagu-Douglas-Scott, were instrumental in developing and establishing the modern Labrador breed in 19th century England. The dogs Avon (""Buccleuch Avon"") and Ned given by Malmesbury to assist the Duke of Buccleuch's breeding program in the 1880s are considered the ancestors of modern Labradors.<sup id=""cite_ref-pslra_9-0""> </sup> The first St. John's dog was said to be brought to England in or around 1820; however, the breed's reputation had spread to England long before. There is a story that the Earl of Malmesbury saw a St. John's Dog on a fishing boat and immediately made arrangements with traders to have some of these dogs exported to England. These ancestors of the first labradors so impressed the Earl with their skill and ability for retrieving anything within the water and on shore that he devoted his entire kennel to developing and stabilizing the breed.

In 1822, explorer W.E. Cormack crossed the island of Newfoundland by foot. In his journal he wrote ""The dogs are admirably trained as retrievers in fowling, and are otherwise useful.....The smooth or short haired dog is preferred because in frosty weather the long haired kind become encumbered with ice on coming out of the water.""<sup id=""cite_ref-great_dane_11-0""> </sup> Another early report by a Colonel Hawker described the dog as ""by far the best for any kind of shooting. He is generally black and no bigger than a Pointer, very fine in legs, with short, smooth hair and does not carry his tail so much curled as the other; is extremely quick, running, swimming and fighting....and their sense of smell is hardly to be credited....""<sup id=""cite_ref-great_dane_11-1""> </sup> In his book <i>Excursions In and About Newfoundland During the Years 1839 and 1840</i>, the geologist Joseph Beete Jukes describes the St. John's Water Dog. ""A thin, short-haired, black dog came off-shore to us to-day. The animal was of a breed very different from what we understand by the term Newfoundland dog in England. He had a thin, tapering snout, a long thin tail, and rather thin, but powerful legs, with a lank body, ? the hair short and smooth."" wrote Jukes. ""These are the most abundant dogs in the country...They are no means handsome, but are generally more intelligent and useful than the others...I observed he once or twice put his foot in the water and paddled it about. This foot was white, and Harvey said he did it to ""toil"" or entice the fish. The whole proceeding struck me as remarkable, more especially as they said he had never been taught anything of the kind."" <h2>Name</h2> The foundational breed of what is now the Labrador Retriever was known as the St. John's water dog, St. John's Dog, or Lesser Newfoundland. When the dogs were later brought to England, they were named after the geographic area known as ""the Labrador"" (they were known as Labrador Retrievers because they ""retrieved"" in the Labrador Sea) or simplyLabrador to distinguish them from the larger Newfoundland breed, even though the breed was from the more southern Avalon Peninsula. The Labrador retriever is actually from Newfoundland; exceptionally, the Newfoundland (dog) was created near the same time in Labrador. The two breeds' names and origins were mixed once moved into England and the Americas. The dog from Labrador became the large, long furred dog we see and know today, and the dog from Newfoundland became the Labrador. <h2>Historical landmarks</h2> The first written reference to the breed was in 1814 (""Instructions to Young Sportsmen"" by Colonel Peter Hawker), the first painting in 1823 (""Cora. A Labrador Bitch"" by Edwin Landseer), and the first photograph in 1856 (the Earl of Home's dog ""Nell"", described both as a Labrador and a St. Johns dog). By 1870 the name Labrador Retriever became common in England. The first yellow Labrador on record was born in 1899 (Ben of Hyde, kennels of Major C.J. Radclyffe), and the breed was recognised by The Kennel Club in 1903. The first American Kennel Club (AKC) registration was in 1917. The chocolate Labrador emerged in the 1930s, although liver spotted pups were documented being born at the Buccleuch kennels in 1892. The first dog to appear on the cover of Life Magazine was a black Labrador Retriever called ?Blind of Arden? in the December, 12th, 1938 issue. The St. John's dog survived until the early 1980s, the last two individuals being photographed in old age around 1981.<sup id=""cite_ref-lorken_7-2""> </sup> <h2>History of subtypes</h2> Yellow and chocolate pups would occasionally appear (although often culled), until finally gaining acceptance in the 20th century. The first recognized yellow Labrador was Ben of Hyde, born in 1899, and chocolate Labradors became more established in the 1930s., There is also a significant difference between show Labs, which tend to be short legged and very heavy, and field Labs which have a more functional and athletic build. Generally these two subtypes have different general features such as facial or body types. <h3>Yellow (and similar shades)</h3> In the early years of the breed through to the mid-20th century, Labradors of a shade we would now call ""yellow"" were in fact a dark, almost butterscotch, colour (visible in early yellow Labrador photographs). The shade was known as ""Golden"" until required to be changed by the UK Kennel Club, on the grounds that ""Gold"" was not actually a colour. Over the 20th century a preference for far lighter shades of yellow through to cream prevailed, until today most yellow Labradors are of this shade. Also fawn has been a common colour in the yellow lab variety.<sup id=""cite_ref-Little_River_13-0""> </sup> Interest in the darker shades of gold and fox red were re-established by English breeders in the 1980s, and three dogs were instrumental in this change: Balrion King Frost (black, born c. 1976) who consistently sired ""very dark yellow"" offspring and is credited as having ""the biggest influence in the re-development of the fox red shade"",and his great-grandson, the likewise famous Wynfaul Tabasco (b. 1986), described as ""the father of the modern fox red Labrador"", and the only modern fox red Show Champion in the UK. Other dogs, such as Red Alert and Scrimshaw Placido Flamingo, are also credited with passing on the genes into more than one renowned bloodline.<sup id=""cite_ref-Little_River_13-2""> </sup> <h3>Chocolate Labradors</h3> Jack Vanderwyk traces the origins of all chocolate Labradors listed on the LabradorNet database (some 34,000 Labrador dogs of all shades) to eight original bloodlines. However, the shade was not seen as a distinct colour until the 20th century; before then according to Vanderwyk, such dogs can be traced but were not registered. A degree of crossbreedingwith Flatcoat or Chesapeake Bay retrievers was also documented in the early 20th century, prior to recognition. Chocolate Labradors were also well established in the early 20th century at the kennels of the Earl of Feversham, and Lady Ward of Chiltonfoliat.<sup id=""cite_ref-Vanderwyk_15-0""> </sup> The bloodlines as traced by Vanderwyk each lead back to three black Labradors in the 1880s?Buccleuch Avon (m), and his sire and dam, Malmesbury Tramp (m), and Malmesbury June (f). Morningtown Tobla is also named as an important intermediary, and according to the studbook of Buccleuch Kennels, the chocolates in this kennel came through FTW Peter of Faskally (1908). <div style=""display: inline !important;""></div> <h2>Description</h2> <h3>Appearance</h3> Labradors are relatively large, with males typically weighing 29 to 41 kg (64 to 90 lb) and females 25 to 32 kg (55 to 71 lb). Labradors weighing close to or over 100 lb (45 kg) are considered obese or having a major fault under American Kennel Club standards, although some Labradors weigh significantly more. The majority of the characteristics of this breed, with the exception of colour, are the result of breeding to produce a working retriever. As with some other breeds, the Conformation (typically ""English"", ""show"" or ""bench"") and the Field (typically ""American"" or ""working"") lines differ, although both lines are bred in both countries. In general, however, Conformation Labradors tend to be bred as medium-sized dogs, shorter and stockier with fuller faces and a slightly calmer nature than their Field counterparts, which are often bred as taller, lighter-framed dogs, with slightly less broad faces and a slightly longer nose; however Field Labradors should still be proportional and fit within AKC standards. With field Labradors, excessively long noses, thin heads, long legs and lanky frames are not considered standard. These two types are informal and not codified or standardised; no distinction is made by the AKC or other kennel clubs, but the two types come from different breeding lines. Australian stock also exists; though not seen in the west, they are common in Asia. These dogs are also very good with children. The breed tends to shed hair twice annually, or regularly throughout the year in temperate climates. Some Labradors shed considerably; however, individual Labradors vary. Labrador hair is usually short and straight, and the tail is quite broad and strong. Thewebbed toes of the Labrador Retriever make them excellent swimmers. The webbing between their toes can also serve as a ""snowshoe"" in colder climates and keep snow from balling up between their toes- a condition that can be painful to other breeds with hair between the toes. Their interwoven coat is also relatively waterproof, providing more assistance for swimming. <h4>Official breed standards</h4> There is a great deal of variety among Labradors. The following characteristics are typical of the conformation show bred (bench-bred) lines of this breed in the United States, and are based on the AKC standard.Significant differences between UK and US standards are noted. <ul> <li><b>Size</b>: Labradors are a relatively large breed. They should be as long from the withers to the base of the tail as they are from the floor to the withers. Males should stand 22.5 to 24.5 inches (57 to 62 cm) tall at the withers and weight 65 to 80 lb (29 to 36 kg). Females should stand 21.5 to 23.5 inches (55 to 60 cm) and weigh 55 to 70 lb (25 to 32 kg).

Some dogs are sold as ""silver"" pure-bred Labradors, but purity of those bloodlines is currently under dispute. When the silver color first showed up in Labradors it came from a kennel that also bred Weimaraners and the dilute gene that causes a silver color is not found in the purebred Labrador Retriever. Some major kennel clubs around the world allow ""Silver"" Labradors to be registered, but not as 'Silver'. The Kennel Club (England) requires that they be registered as 'Non-recognised'. The parent club for the Labrador Retriever in the USA (the LRC) states publicly that 'There is no genetic basis for the silver gene in Labradors'. Although the people trying to breed for a silver color claim the AKC will recognize silver in reality it is the National club that would need to do so, NOT the AKC and they have stated publicly that this is something they will never do. Occasionally, Labradors will exhibit small amounts of white fur on their chest, paws or tail, and rarely a purebred Lab will exhibit brindling stripes or tan points similar to a Rottweiler. These markings are a disqualification for show dogs but do not have any bearing on the dog's temperament or ability to be a good working or pet dog. Puppies of all colours can potentially occur in the same litter. Colour is determined primarily by three genes. The first gene (the B locus) determines the density of the coat's eumelanin pigment granules, if that pigment is allowed: dense granules result in a black coat, sparse ones give a chocolate coat. The second (E) locus determines whether the eumelanin is produced at all. A dog with the recessive e allele will produce only phaeomelanin pigment and will be yellow regardless of its genotype at the B locus. The genes known about previously have had their number increased by the introduction of the K locus, where the dominant ""black"" allele K<sup>B</sup> is now known to reside. Black or chocolate Labradors therefore must have the K<sup>B</sup> allele. Yellow Labradors are determined at the E locus, so the K locus is irrelevant in determining their colour. Variations in numerous other genes control the subtler details of the coat's colouration, which in yellow Labradors varies from white to light gold to a fox red. Chocolate and black Labradors' noses will match the coat colour. According to a 2011 study, 13 out of 245 Labradors studied were heterozygous for the M264V mutation responsible for the melanistic mask, and one was homozygous. Within the breed, this trait is not visible.<sup id=""cite_ref-23""> </sup> <h5>Nose and skin pigmentation</h5> Because Labrador colouration is controlled by multiple genes, it is possible for recessivegenes to emerge some generations later and also there can sometimes be unexpectedpigmentation effects to different parts of the body. Pigmentation effects appear in regard to yellow Labradors, and sometimes chocolate, and hence the majority of this section covers pigmentation within the yellow Labrador. The most common places where pigmentation is visible are the nose, lips, gums, feet, tail, and the rims of the eyes, which may be black, brown, light yellow-brown (""liver"", caused by having two genes for chocolate), or several other colours. A Labrador can carry genes for a different colour, for example a black Labrador can carry recessive chocolate and yellow genes, and a yellow Labrador can carry recessive genes for the other two colours. DNA testing can reveal some aspects of these. Less common pigmentations (other than pink) are a fault, not a disqualification, and hence such dogs are still permitted to be shown. The intensity of black pigment on yellow Labradors is controlled by a separate gene independent of the fur colouring. Yellow Labradors usually have black noses, which may gradually turn pink with age (called ""snow nose"" or ""winter nose""). This is due to a reduction in the enzyme tyrosinase which indirectly controls the production of melanin, a dark colouring. Tyrosinase is temperature dependent?hence light colouration can be seasonal, due to cold weather?and is less produced with increasing age two years old onwards. As a result, the nose colour of most yellow Labradors becomes a somewhat pink shade as they grow older.<sup id=""cite_ref-woodhaven_pigmentation_24-3""> </sup> A colouration known as ""Dudley"" is also possible. Dudleys are variously defined as yellow Labradors which have unpigmented (pink) noses (LRC), yellow with liver/chocolate pigmentation (AKC), or ""flesh coloured"" in addition to having the same colour around the rims of the eye, rather than having black or dark brown pigmentation. A yellow Labrador with brown or chocolate pigmentation, for example, a brown or chocolate nose, is not necessarily a Dudley, though according to the AKC's current standard it would be if it has chocolate rims around the eyes (or more accurately of the genotype eebb). Breed standards for Labradors considers a true Dudley to be a disqualifying feature in a conformation show Lab, such as one with a thoroughly pink nose or one lacking in any pigment along with flesh coloured rims around the eyes. True Dudleys are extremely rare. Breeding in order to correct pigmentation often lacks dependability. Because colour is determined by many genes, some of which are recessive, crossbreeding a pigmentation non-standard yellow Labrador to a black Labrador may not correct the matter or prevent future generations carrying the same recessive genes. For similar reasons, crossbreeding chocolate to yellow Labradors is also often avoided. <h4>Show and field lines</h4> As a result of specialised breeding there are significant differences between field and trial-bred and show-bred lines of Labradors. In the United States the former are sometimes mistakenly referred to as ""American"" and the latter as ""English"" although both field and show types are bred in both countries. In the United Kingdom they are called ""Field"" and ""Show"". Dogs bred for hunting and field-trial work are selected first for working ability, where dogs bred to compete in conformation shows are selected for their conformation to the standards and characteristics sought by judges in the show ring. While individual dogs may vary, in general show-bred Labradors are heavier built, slightly shorter-bodied, and have a thicker coat and tail. Field Labradors are generally longer legged, lighter, and more lithe in build, making them agile. In the head, show Labradors tend to have broader heads, better defined stops, and more powerful necks, while field Labradors have lighter and slightly narrower heads with longer muzzles.Field-bred Labradors are commonly higher energy and more high-strung compared to the Labrador bred for conformation showing while conformation breeds are calmer in energy, and as a consequence may be more suited to working relationships than being a ""family pet"". Some breeders, especially those specialising in the field type, feel that breed shows do not adequately recognise their type of dog, leading to occasional debate regarding officially splitting the breed into subtypes.<sup id=""cite_ref-29""> </sup> In the United States, the AKC and the Labrador's breed club have set the breed standard to accommodate the field-bred Labrador somewhat. For instance, the AKC withers-height standards allow conformation dogs to be slightly taller than the equivalent British standard. However, dual champions, or dogs that excel in both the field and the show ring, are becoming more unusual.<sup id=""cite_ref-31""> </sup> <h2>Temperament</h2> The AKC describes the Labrador's temperament as a kind, pleasant, outgoing and tractable nature. Labradors' sense of smell allows them to home in on almost any scent and follow the path of its origin. They generally stay on the scent until they find it. Navies, military forces and police forces use them as detection dogs to track down smugglers, thieves, terrorists and black marketers. Labradors instinctively enjoy holding objects and even hands or arms in their mouths, which they can do with great gentleness (a Labrador can carry an egg in its mouth without breaking it). They are known to have a very soft feel to the mouth, as a result of being bred to retrieve game such as waterfowl. They are prone to chewing objects (though they can be trained to abandon this behavior). The Labrador Retriever's coat repels water to some extent, thus facilitating the extensive use of the dog in waterfowl hunting. Labradors have a reputation as a very even-tempered breed and an excellent family dog. This includes a good reputation with children of all ages and other animals. Some lines, particularly those that have continued to be bred specifically for their skills at working in the field (rather than for their appearance), are particularly fast and athletic. Their fun-loving boisterousness and lack of fear may require training and firm handling at times to ensure it does not get out of hand?an uncontrolled adult can be quite problematic. Females may be slightly more independent than males. Labradors mature at around three years of age; before this time they can have a significant degree of puppy-like energy, often mislabelled as being hyperactive. Because of their enthusiasm, leash-training early on is suggested to prevent pulling when full-grown.Labradors often enjoy retrieving a ball endlessly (often obsessively) and other forms of activity (such as agility, frisbee, or flyball). Although they will sometimes bark at noise, especially noise from an unseen source (""alarm barking""), Labradors are usually not noisy or territorial. They are often very easygoing and trusting with strangers and therefore are not usually suitable as guard dogs.<sup id=""cite_ref-pslra_9-7""> </sup> Labradors have a well-known reputation for appetite, and some individuals may be highly indiscriminate, eating digestible and non-food objects alike. They are persistent and persuasive in requesting food. For this reason, the Labrador owner must carefully control their dog's food intake to avoid obesity and its associated health problems (see below). The steady temperament of Labradors and their ability to learn make them an ideal breed for search and rescue, detection, and therapy work. They are a very intelligent breed. They are ranked # 7 in Stanley Coren's <i>The Intelligence of Dogs</i>. The AKC describes the breed as an ideal family and sporting dog. Their primary working role in the field continues to be that of a hunting retriever. <h3>Exploration</h3> Labradors do not typically jump high fences or dig, but because of their personalities, some Labradors climb and/or jump for their own amusement. As a breed they are highly intelligent and capable of intense single-mindedness and focus if motivated or their interest is caught. Therefore, with the right conditions and stimuli, a bored Labrador could ""turn into an escape artist <i>par excellence</i>"".<sup id=""cite_ref-pslra_9-8""> </sup><sup id=""cite_ref-35""></sup> Labradors as a breed are curious, exploratory and love company, following both people and interesting scents for food, attention and novelty value. In this way, they can often ""vanish"" or otherwise become separated from their owners with little fanfare. Many dogs are also stolen. Because of their curious nature and ability to ""vanish,"" along with the risk of being stolen, a number of dog clubs and rescue organizations (including the UK's Kennel Club) consider it good practice that Labradors be microchipped, with the owner's name and address also on their collar and tags.<sup id=""cite_ref-allaboutLabradors_36-1""> </sup><sup id=""cite_ref-dogrescue_chip_2_38-0""></sup> [button link=""http://alphamatch.com/listing-type/pets/?pet-type=1081&amp;breed-2=611"" color=""black"" type=""big-button"" type=""Search for Labrador Retriever""]Search for Labrador Retriever[/button] &nbsp; <h3>Use as working dogs</h3> Labradors are an intelligent breed with a good work ethic and generally good temperaments. Common working roles for Labradors include: hunting, tracking and detection (they have a great sense of smell which helps when working in these areas), disabled-assistance, carting, and therapy work.<sup id=""cite_ref-working_dogs_39-0"">[39]</sup> Approximately 60?70% of all guide dogs in Canada are Labradors; other common breeds areGolden Retrievers and German Shepherds.<sup id=""cite_ref-moore_service_dog_info_40-0"">[40]</sup> Labrador Retrievers have proven to have a high success rate at becoming guide dogs. A study was recently done on how well four different breeds (Labrador Retriever, Golden Retriever, Labrador Retriever/Golden Retriever Mix, and German Shepherds) trained to become guide dogs. In this experiment, German Shepherds had the highest chance of not completing it. Labrador Retrievers and Labrador Retriever/Golden Retriever Mix had the highest success rate. However, German Shepherds and Golden Retrievers had a higher success rate after going through longer training than the training required for Labrador Retrievers.<sup id=""cite_ref-41"">[41]</sup><sup id=""cite_ref-42"">[42]</sup> Labradors are powerful and indefatigable swimmers noted for their ability to tolerate the coldest of water for extended periods of time. Their ability to work quietly alongside hunters while watching for birds to fall from the sky, marking where they land, and then using their outstanding nose to find and retrieve dead or wounded birds has made them the king of waterfowl retrievers. They are also used for pointing and flushing and make excellent upland game hunting partners.<sup id=""cite_ref-44""> </sup> The high intelligence, initiative and self-direction of Labradors in working roles is exemplified by dogs such as Endal, who during a 2001 emergency placed an unconscious human being in the recovery position, retrieved his mobile phone from beneath the car, fetched a blanket and covered him, barked at nearby dwellings for assistance, and then ran to a nearby hotel to obtain help. A number of Labradors have also been taught to assist their owner in removing money and credit cards from ATMs with prior training.<sup id=""cite_ref-46""> </sup> The breed is used in water rescue/lifesaving. It continues in that role today, along with the Leonberger, Newfoundland and Golden Retriever dogs; they are used at the Italian School of Canine Lifeguard.<sup id=""cite_ref-47""> </sup> <h2>Health</h2> Labrador pups generally are not brought to the home before they are 8 weeks old. Their life expectancy is generally 10 to 12 years, and it is a healthy breed with relatively few major problems. Notable issues related to health and well-being include: <h3>Inherited disorders</h3> <ul> <li>Labradors are somewhat prone to hip and elbow dysplasia, especially the larger dogs,<sup id=""cite_ref-51"">[51]</sup> though not as much as some other breeds.Hip scores are recommended before breeding and often joint supplements are recommended.</li> <li>Labradors also suffer from the risk of knee problems. A luxating patella is a common occurrence in the knee where the knee dislocates and goes back into place.</li> <li>Eye problems are also possible in some Labradors, particularly progressive retinal atrophy, cataracts,<sup id=""cite_ref-CGD-eye_53-0"">[53]</sup> corneal dystrophy<sup id=""cite_ref-UPEI_50-1"">[50]</sup> andretinal dysplasia. Dogs which are intended to be bred should be examined by a veterinary ophthalmologist for an eye score.</li> <li>Hereditary myopathy, a rare inherited disorder that causes a deficiency in type II muscle fibre. Symptoms include a short stilted gait or ""bunny hopping,"" and in rare cases ventroflexion of the neck accompanied by a kyphotic posture.<sup id=""cite_ref-HMLR_54-0""> </sup></li> <li>There is a small incidence of other conditions, such as autoimmune diseases and deafness in Labradors, either congenitally or later in life.<sup id=""cite_ref-animalforum_17-1""> </sup></li> <li>Labradors often suffer from exercise induced collapse, a syndrome that causes hyperthermia, weakness, collapse, and disorientation after short bouts of exercise.<sup id=""cite_ref-55""> </sup></li> </ul> <h3>Obesity</h3> Labradors like to eat, and without proper exercise can become obese. Laziness also contributes to this. Obesity is a serious condition and can be considered the number one nutritional problem with dogs. A study shows that at least 25% of dogs in the United States are overweight. Therefore Labradors must be properly exercised and stimulated. A healthy Labrador can do swimming wind sprints for two hours, and should keep a very slight hourglass waist and be fit and light, rather than fat or heavy-set. Obesity can exacerbate conditions such as hip dysplasia and joint problems, and can lead to secondary diseases, including diabetes. Osteoarthritis is common in older, especially overweight, Labradors. A 14 year study covering 48 dogs by food manufacturer Purina showed that Labradors fed to maintain a lean body shape outlived those fed freely by around two years, emphasising the importance of not over-feeding. Labradors should be walked twice a day for at least half an hour.<sup id=""cite_ref-Purina_57-0""> </sup> <h2>Appearance around the world</h2> In the United States, the breed gained wider recognition following a 1928 American Kennel Gazette article, <i>""Meet the Labrador Retriever""</i>. Before this time, the AKC had only registered 23 Labradors in the country, in part because US and UK hunting styles had different requirements. Labradors acquired popularity as hunting dogs during the 1920s and especially after World War II, as they gained recognition as combining some of the best traits of the two favourite United States breeds as both game finders and water dogs.<sup id=""cite_ref-burdick_58-1""> </sup> Outside North America and Western Europe, the Labrador arrived later. For example, the Russian Retriever Club traces the arrival of Labradors to the late 1960s, as household pets of diplomats and others in the foreign ministry. The establishment of the breed in the Commonwealth of Independent States (former USSR) was initially hindered by the relatively small numbers of Labradors and great distances involved, leading to difficulty establishing breedings and bloodl",NULL,NULL,NULL,"Y","0"

They generally have sharp senses, though their eyesight is more sensitive to motion than detail. They are very loyal and loving, making them the perfect family companion. Some are easy to train, and many get along with other animals quite easily if they're socialized as puppies. Lagottos vary in their need for exercise, but should always be given stimulation to keep their intelligent brains occupied. Lagottos have a natural instinct for retrieving. The ENCI (Italian Kennel Club) Country of Origin standard indicates that the game-hunting instinct has been bred out, and they do not get distracted by game or other wildlife; this was untrue when it was written and is certainly untrue twenty years later. Lagotto have been hunting dogs for at least three thousand years, and truffle dogs for maybe a hundred years, if that. The original standard, written by those who founded C.I.L. (the Club Italiano Lagotto), in Imola in 1988, who were writing a standard to get the Lagotto recognized by ENCI, and not necessarily as an absolutely true reflection of the breed. It is worth noting that the first pair (Reno &amp; Rosetta) bought to pioneer the Lagotto in the UK in 1996 came from the Mandriole kennels on the edge of the Comaccio where the dogs were still worked from the traditional flat-bottomed punts as duck retrievers;those Lagotto, through subsequent exports from the UK which provided the foundation stock for Canada, USA and Australia, can be found behind many Lagotto world-wide. Visitors to the Lagotto Romagnolo Club of Great Britain breed stand, at the world famous Crufts Dog Show in the UK, will have seen photographs of GB Lagotto (including Rosetta) retrieving hare, rabbit, grouse and various types of wildfowl. It is also worth noting that the photograph on the back of the first official video produced in Italy circa 1996 showed a group of Lagotto going off working - not truffling but duck-shooting from a punt; in that punt were the parents and grandparents of Rosetta and Reno. Whilst the instinct to hunt, swim and retrieve is inborn, and does not have to be encouraged, Lagotto have to be trained from an early age to look for truffles. In modern times, the Lagotto has been bred primarily as a truffle-searching dog, and not as a retriever or hunting dog. Their highly developed nose makes them excellent search dogs. Some Lagotto are excellent swimmers, but some will only paddle. Some will retrieve from lakes, streams and other bodies of water without hesitation. Not all Lagotto are suitable as family companions, puppies for families with small children need to be carefully chosen. They can make excellent domestic companions provided they have sufficient exercise. Lagottos love to dig; many owners give them a sandbox, or have a designated place to allow them satisfy their digging urges. They also love to play seeking-games and have very active minds. <h2>Grooming</h2> There are conflicting ideas on how to groom this breed. Some say they should be brushed regularly and others believe their coat should be allowed to grow naturally into a big fluff. The coat will get matted easily and the mats should be carefully pulled apart without tearing the coat. They must be cut down at least once every year.

The Lakeland is similar in appearance to the slightly larger Welsh Terrier and is finer-boned. The largest of the threesome in this similar group of Terriers is the Airedale. The Lakeland is a sturdy dog, compact, free moving and able to cover ground with little effort and much quickness. The dog is relatively narrow in the chest and has a broad muzzle, yet slightly narrower than the Welsh Terrier, with small, V-shaped ears.<sup id=""cite_ref-Alderton_2-5""> </sup> The Lakeland breed has a thick bushy wiry outer coat and a soft undercoat. It comes in a variety of colors though the Kennel Club lists the following as 'Acceptable colours for registration': Black, Black and Tan, Blue and Tan, Dark Grizzle, Grizzle, Grizzle and Tan, Liver and Tan, Red, Red Grizzle, Wheaten. They have an upright tail which was previously customarily docked. Lakeland Terriers grow to between 33 and 38 cm (13 to 15 inches) in height measured to the withers. The eyes are small and dark colored and of oval shape. The nose and pads of the feet are black except in liver colored dogs where the nose and pad coloring will be liver colored. Liver colored dogs will have a slightly lighter colored eye. The dog will not shed if properly groomed. It is suggested that ""Regular stripping and trimming improves the texture and quality of the coat"" and is ""necessary to enhance the dog's utilitarian purposes"" as well as ""enhancing him for the show ring"".<sup id=""cite_ref-us_lakeland_terrier_show_ring_9-0""> </sup> <h3>Temperament</h3> The dogs are friendly, bold, and confident. Shyness is very atypical, as is aggressiveness. Very intelligent and independent minded, they are quick to learn and easy to train though Lakelands often exhibit 'selective deafness' when their interest level is aroused. The Lakeland is quite receptive to crate training. As with most terriers, the Lakeland is energetic; daily exercise and playtimes are a must, lest this active dog seek out other outlets for their energy, with undesirable results for the owner.<sup id=""cite_ref-Alderton_2-12""> </sup> <h2>History</h2> The UK Kennel Club claims to have recognised Lakeland Terriers in 1921, whereas the Lakeland Terrier Club suggests this was closer to 1928.

The Lakeland Terrier Club was founded in 1932<sup id=""cite_ref-lakeland_terrier_club_origin_1-3"">[1]</sup> and promoted the breed nationally through Kennel-Club sanctioned shows. In the Lake District of the UK, the mountainous, rocky terrain is unsuitable for hunting fox on horseback and foxes were hunted on foot. It has been suggested that the Lakeland Terrier's great stamina derives from running all day with the hounds, unlike his close cousin, the fox terrier, who would have been carried in a saddle bag to be released only when the fox had gone to earth.<sup id=""cite_ref-Alderton_2-16""> </sup> As one of the earliest Terriers (Latin derivation of earth), dating from the 1700s, this ""earth"" dog is a descendant of the old English Black and Tan and Fell Terriers.

Its size and energy make it popular as a hunter in hard to reach places; the breed is among those eligible for competition in sanctioned Earthdog trials. The working dog version of the Lakeland is often known as the Fell Terrier or Patterdale Terrier.

Such dogs were not of modern breeds of documented heritage, and did not have a fixed appearance, but rather were a landrace type of herding dog. Although Swedish and Finnish dog fanciersbegan collecting information about the type in the 1930s, most of the dogs were lost as a result of World War II. After the war various breeders in Sweden and Finland began to try to recreate the lost reindeer herding dogs in their various forms. In Finland, the first was recognised as the Kukonharjulainen (a kennel name) by the Finnish Kennel Club. The breed was a few of the herding dogs crossed with black and white Karelian Bear Dogs, resulting in a short-coated dog. Other breeders with another kennel club in Finland created another breed, this one with a more heavy coat, called the Lapponian Herder. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, more dogs were collected, and assigned to one of the two varieties based on their appearance. Around the same time the two kennel clubs merged, and all the Finnish reindeer dogs were placed in the same registry. In 1966 they were separated again, based on coat length. One breed was renamed Lapphund at that time, and the other was named Lapinporokoira (translated into English as the Lapponian Herder.)<sup id=""cite_ref-3"">[3]</sup> The Lapinporokoira is recognised under Finnish sponsorship as F",NULL,NULL,NULL,"Y","0"

Bulldogs pictured as late as 1870 resemble contemporary American Staffordshire Terriers to a greater degree than present-day Bulldogs. Some writers contend it was the White English Terrier, Fox Terrier, or the Black and Tan Terrier that was crossed with the Bulldog to develop the Staffordshire Terrier; all three breeds shared many traits, the greatest differences being in color, and spirit. The cross of Bulldog and Terrier was called by several names, including Bull-and-Terrier Dog, Pit Bull, or Half and Half. Later, it assumed the name of Staffordshire Bull Terrier in England. These dogs began to find their way into America as early as 1870, where they became known as the Pit Dog, then the American Bull Terrier, and still later as the Yankee Terrier.<sup id=""cite_ref-akc.org_2-1""> </sup></div> <h3>Popularity</h3> In 1936, Amstaffs were accepted for registration in the American Kennel Club (AKC) Stud Book as Staffordshire Terriers, belonging to the terrier and molosser groups.

Rats soon became a health menace and rat killing became a popular sport. John Hulme, enthusiastic devotee of the sport of rat killing and rabbit coursing, crossed a Whippet to a cross bred terrier to produce a tenacious, streamlined animal better suited to the sport. This cross proved so successful that it was repeated, resulting in the establishment of a definite type. By 1827 the breed's fighting spirit had made it equally handy along a hedge row as in a rat-pit. The Manchester could tackle an opponent twice its size. Ears were cropped to save risk of being torn in frequent scraps. (This also enhanced the sharp appearance of the expression). When rat-killing became illegal in England rat-pits were supplanted by dining halls or public inns, all of which were infested by rats. To combat the rodent problem each inn kept kennels. By 1860 Manchester was the breed centre for these ""Rat Terriers"", and so the name Manchester Terrier became established. Smaller specimens began to gain appeal.

Centuries of breeding the dogs to be gentle with lambs but fiercely protective of their flock has created a breed that will bond to families and show a calm, intelligent disposition. However, the dogs may display hostility towards outsiders and they are not suitable companion dogs for urban areas due to their large size and need for open space. These dogs bark as a normal part of their guarding duties and this creates problems often with owners on small holdings or keeping a maremma as a companion in a populated area.

He settled on a 10,000 acre ranch, which he named the McNab Ranch. McNab, dissatisfied with the working ranch dogs available locally, traveled back to Scotland in 1885, to find the type of dogs he had worked with while raising sheep. He eventually bought two Scotch Collies, Peter and Fred. He returned to California with Peter, while he left Fred in Scotland to finish his training. He imported him back to his ranch later. Being males, McNab had Peter and Fred bred with two females supposedly of Spanish origin, brought by Basque sheep herders from the Basque region of Northern Spain. Other sources claim that they were, in fact, bred with other Scotch Collies. McNab later imported several more collies from Scotland, some of which were red and white Fox Collies. Some McNab dogs share this coloration, as previously mentioned. The McNabs were bred as the perfect cattle dog, that could both head and heel. They are still used in California ranches and stockyards today. <h3>Temperament</h3> The primary quality that these dogs are bred for is their herding ability; they are well known as cattle herders, but can herd other animals, such as horses, sheep, and llamas. McNabs are well-mannered dogs, are hard-working, have good personal hygiene, and are friendly with small domestic animals such as cats and chickens, but require extensive grounds in which to run and are happiest with a job to do. The McNab can also be an excellent deer and boar hunting dog. The McNab is also less 'high strung' or obsessive than the Border Collie. They were bred to have more ""backbone"" than the original Border Collie. It is common for a McNab to bark while they herd. They should exercise physically but also mentally by learning new activities or 'tricks' and being allowed to explore and learn new environments. This breed is sociable with other dogs and humans. <h3></h3> [button link=""http://alphamatch.com/listing-type/pets/?pet-type=1081&amp;breed-2=1035"" color=""black"" type=""big-button"" type=""Search for McNab""]Search for McNab[/button]",NULL,NULL,NULL,"Y","0"

Archaeological evidence shows that the breed has existed in Mexico for more than 3,000 years. Most likely, early forerunners of the Xolo originated as spontaneous hairless mutations of indigenous American dogs. Hairlessness may have offered a survival advantage in tropical regions. Indigenous peoples of Mexico, Central and South America had Xolo dogs as home and hunting companions, and today they are still very popular companion dogs. They are also the national dog of Mexico. Their value in ancient native cultures is evidenced by their frequent appearance in art and artifacts: for example, those produced by the Colima, Aztec and Toltec civilizations in Mexico. Xolos were considered sacred dogs by the Aztecs (and also Toltecs, Maya and some other groups) because they believed the dogs were needed by their masters? souls to help them safely through the underworld. They were also useful companion animals. According to Aztec mythology, the god Xolotl made the Xoloitzcuintli from a sliver of the Bone of Life from which all mankind was made. Xolotl gave this gift to Man with the instruction to guard it with his life and in exchange it would guide Man through the dangers of Mictlan, the world of Death, toward the Evening Star in the Heavens. Some people in Mexico continue to believe this breed has healing qualities. The Aztecs also raised the breed for their meat. Sixteenth-century Spanish accounts tell of large numbers of dogs being served at banquets. Aztec Merchant feasts could have 80-100 turkeys and 20-40 dogs served as food. When these two meats were served in the same dish, the dog meat was at the bottom of the dish, either because it was held in higher regard or because it was increasingly considered a step above cannibalism<sup id=""cite_ref-Aguilar_5-1""><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_Hairless_Dog#cite_note-Aguilar-5""> </a></sup> &nbsp; [button link=""http://alphamatch.com/listing-type/pets/?pet-type=1081&amp;breed-2=1035"" color=""black"" type=""big-button"" type=""Search for Mexican Hairless Dog""]Search for Mexican Hairless Dog[/button] &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;",NULL,NULL,NULL,"Y","0"

They are easily trainable because they crave approval. Once given proper socialization they will thrive in a variety of environments, provided they have an adequate outlet for both physical and mental energy. If they are not allowed adequate stimuli they may become destructive. Because of their herding background, they also may have the tendency to try to herd people, especially small children, nipping at their heels. As long as this behavior is put in check when they are young, they will generally be fine. They are social dogs and form close attachments to their owner. As a result, some may suffer separation anxiety. Minis function well as a family dog, but their excessive energy may need to be checked around small children. They are generally great house dogs but do require a large amount of exercise. They are particularly apprehensive with strangers. <h2>History</h2> In 1968 Doris Cordova, a horse woman in Norco, California, began a breeding program specifically to produce very small breed founded with Australian Shepherds. Her foundation stud was Cordova's Spike. Spike was placed with Bill and Sally Kennedy, also of Norco, California, to continue to develop a line of smaller dogs under the B/S kennel name. Another horseman, Chas Lasater of Valhalla Kennels, soon joined the ranks of mini breeders. In the 1980s fanciers formed member clubs (North American Miniature Australian Shepherd Club of the USA and the Miniature Australian Shepherd Association) and registries to promote the smaller dogs in particular. Doris Cordova wrote a letter of explanation regarding the intent of developing the breed which was published in the National Stock Dog Magazine, Vol. 28, No.1 Spring issue of 1982.<sup id=""cite_ref-1""><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miniature_Australian_Shepherd#cite_note-1""> </a></sup> &nbsp; [button link=""http://alphamatch.com/listing-type/pets/?pet-type=1081&amp;breed-2=1035"" color=""black"" type=""big-button"" type=""Search for Miniature Australian Shepherd""]Search for Miniature Australian Shepherd[/button]",NULL,NULL,NULL,"Y","0"

The breed standard adopted by the AKC states for size: ""The preferred height for males is 20?23 inches, females 18?21 inches. Quality is not to be sacrificed in favor of size."" Interestingly, deviation in size is not a disqualification, and this has been a debated issue. In 1993 the original MASCUSA club was asked by the AKC to change its name. Additionally, Miniature Australian Shepherds could no longer participate under their chosen name as it was too similar to that of an AKC affiliated breed, so the Miniature Australian Shepherd became the <b>North American Shepherd</b>. In 1993, MASCUSA (the original organization) became the North American Shepherd Club of America. For the next 15 years there were numerous clubs that were formed, reorganized, and defunct trying to come to a consensus concerning the emerging breed. Enough members were eventually interested in obtaining separate recognition, thus prompting members of NAMASCUSA to approach the AKC. Working as a team with AKC and USASA, the name and breed of Miniature American Shepherd was born. The Miniature Australian Shepherd community is still divided over this compromise. In May 2011, this resulted in the MASCUSA club being chosen by AKC as the parent club of the newly named Miniature American Shepherd recognized breed. The Miniature American Shepherd Club of the USA is currently working toward full, AKC recognition and acceptance.<sup id=""cite_ref-AKC_3-4""><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miniature_American_Shepherd#cite_note-AKC-3""> </a></sup> <h2>Characteristics</h2> This small, athletic breed has moderate bone and slightly rectangular proportions.

Hunters were seeking a smaller, speedy Fox Terrier that could be used for hunting smaller pests such as rats and rabbits. Although the origins of the breed are English, the breed was developed in and is endemic to Australia. By the late 19th century, the breed type was clearly identifiable and these small terriers proved their worth against rabbits, rats, and snakes on Australian farms, where they were often known simply as ""the little foxies"". The dogs demonstrated tenacity, endurance, and extreme loyalty to their owners; they were routinely taken on the hunt, were sometimes used in search parties, and were used at Sydney?s North Head Quarantine Station, the Riverstone Meat Works, and the Brisbane City Council as vermin exterminators. The dog?s vigilance, size, affectionate temperament, and ease of care soon resulted in its becoming a popular choice in urban centers as well, and by the 1920s the Miniature Fox Terrier was iconic. So well known and popular was the ?Little Foxie? that very little thought was given to the need to preserve its lines. &nbsp; <h3>Temperament</h3> Bred for hunting rodents (rats, mice) and rabbits principally, these dogs are known for their speed and agility. With the ruthlessness of their attack on rodent pest species and their ability to squeeze into and out of tight spaces, they have made themselves an indispensable part of many Australian farms since the 19th Century. Miniature Fox Terriers have proved well-suited to being domestic pets in more urban environments (according to the breed club). Their diminutive size, short clean hair and loyal acceptance of their place in the social hierarchy make them good pets, particularly in households with small children. They thrive on positive socialization and are happy to be rewarded with pats and praise when being trained and trainers do not have to rely on treats to obtain a good result. Miniature Fox Terriers generally get along well with other animals but, like most working terriers, cannot distinguish between small pets?such as reptiles and fancy rats?and vermin, and so should not be left alone with such animals. They are confident and will generally interact with dogs and other animals many times their size. &nbsp; [button link=""http://alphamatch.com/listing-type/pets/?pet-type=1081&amp;breed-2=1035"" color=""black"" type=""big-button"" type=""Search for Miniature Fox Terrier""]Search for Miniature Fox Terrier[/button]",NULL,NULL,NULL,"Y","0"

They were originally bred to be medium-sized farm dogs in Germany, equally suited to ratting, herding, and guarding property. As time passed, farmers bred the Standard Schnauzer into a smaller, more compact size for ratting by combining it with the Affenpinscher and Miniature Poodle. The first recorded Miniature Schnauzer appeared in 1888, and the first exhibition was held in 1899.<sup id=""cite_ref-akc-history_2-1""> </sup><sup id=""cite_ref-Rugh2009_3-0""></sup> The AKC accepted registration of the new breed in 1926, two years after Miniature Schnauzers were introduced to the United States. They were originally known as Wirehaired Pinschers.Although they are recognized internationally with the Schnauzer and Giant Schnauzer in the Working group, in the AKC the Miniature Schnauzer is classed with the terriers.It was recognized by the United Kennel Club in 1948 and also classed as a terrier.The start of the modern Miniature Schnauzer is generally considered to begin with Ch. Dorem Display, the first Miniature Schnauzer to win Best in Show at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show.He was born 5 April 1945 and lived to be nearly fourteen. Almost every living Miniature Schnauzer in America can trace its lineage back to Dorem Display.<sup id=""cite_ref-ddisplay_7-2""> </sup> &nbsp; <h3>Temperament</h3> The American Kennel Club breed standard describes temperament as ""alert and spirited, yet obedient to command... friendly, intelligent and willing to please... never overaggressive or timid.""Usually easy to train, they tend to be excellent watchdogs with a good territorial instinct, but more inclined toward barking than biting. They are often aloof with strangers until the owners of the home welcome the guest, upon which they are typically very friendly to them.<sup id=""cite_ref-kiedrowski_14-0""> </sup> They are highly playful dogs, and, if not given the outlet required for their energy, they can become bored and invent their own ""fun"". Miniature Schnauzers can compete in dog agility trials, obedience, showmanship, flyball, and tracking. Schnauzers have a high prey drive, which means they may attack other small pets such as birds, snakes, and rodents. Many will also attack cats, but this may be curbed with training, or if the dog is raised with cats.<sup id=""cite_ref-akc_4-3""> </sup> &nbsp; <h2>Health and grooming</h2> A UK Kennel Club survey puts the median lifespan of Miniature Schnauzers at a little over 12 years. About 20% lived to &gt;15 years.<sup id=""cite_ref-15"">[15]</sup> While generally a healthy breed, Miniature Schnauzers may suffer health problems associated with high fat levels. Such problems include hyperlipidemia, which may increase the possibility of pancreatitis, though either may form independently. Other issues which may affect this breed are diabetes, bladder stones and eye problems. Feeding the dog low- or non-fatty and unsweetened foods may help avoid these problems. Miniature Schnauzers are also prone to <i>comedone syndrome</i>, a condition that produces pus filled bumps, usually on their backs, which can be treated with a variety of methods. Miniature Schnauzers should have their ears dried after swimming due to a risk of infection, especially those with uncropped ears; ear examinations should be part of the regular annual check up.<sup id=""cite_ref-tp-groom_20-0"">[20]</sup> Miniature Schnauzers are also prone to von Willebrand disease (vWD). vWD in dogs is an inherited bleeding disorder that occurs due to qualitative or quantitative deficiency of von Willebrand factor (vWF), a multimeric protein that is required for platelet adhesion.<sup id=""cite_ref-21""> </sup> Schnauzers have a specific groom cut that is standard among the Schnauzer breed. Schnauzers require regular grooming, either by stripping (mostly seen in show dogs), or by clipping (a short-cut usually reserved for family pets). Stripping removes the loose, dead coat; it may be done by hand, called finger stripping, or plucking, or with a stripping knife; either way, it is a laborious process. Many Miniature Schnauzers who are family pets have regular grooming appointments to have their hair clipped; clipping, using a mechanical clippers (or shaver), produces a soft, silky, skin-close trim. Whether stripped or clipped, the coat is close at the body, and falls into a fringe-like foundation on its undercarriage, called furnishings, which can be left to grow, but must be combed regularly. All Schnauzers, whether they are Miniatures, Standards, or Giants, often sport a beard, created by allowing the hair around their noses to grow out. Left unclipped or unstripped, the body hair will grow two to four inches, and will often tangle into mats and curls. &nbsp; [button link=""http://alphamatch.com/listing-type/pets/?pet-type=1081&amp;breed-2=1035"" color=""black"" type=""big-button"" type=""Search for Miniature Schnauzer""]Search for Miniature Schnauzer[/button] <h2></h2>",NULL,NULL,NULL,"Y","0"

Over the years this breed became larger as the mastiff influence began to come out. What many people do not know is that the Miniature actually represents a more accurate build of the breeds true dimensions. Until Shar Pei became AKC recognized, and the larger standard was adopted, those breeding what are now known as Miniature Shar Pei were actually breeding the more original size. This was recently discovered through the finding of the gene responsible for the miniature size. Before this many thought that the smaller sized dogs were unhealthy or considered to be mistakes. Today Miniature Shar Pei breeders believe that this breed is a special onto itself and worthy of approval by the American Kennel Club. <h3>Temperament</h3> The Miniature Shar Pei is affectionate, adaptable, playful, confident, calm, independent, regal, and alert. They are inherently clean and quiet. Some can be a bit aloof and though they are wise, obedience training requires a confident, consistent authority figure to prevent them from becoming overly dominant. This breed makes a delightful companion but is very independent with a temperament that will depend highly on how the owner treats the dog. It is a dog that bonds well with its family and is very devoted. Daily walks are needed to give the dog some exercise. During times of increased temperature walks should be shortened as these dogs are somewhat sensitive to the heat.<sup id=""cite_ref-puppyfind_2-1""><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miniature_Shar_Pei#cite_note-puppyfind-2""> </a></sup> &nbsp; <h3>Health</h3> <div>Many of this breeds health issues depend upon the lines that the dog comes from. Dogs with few hereditary issues will tend to be healthier than ones whose parents or grand parents had problems. One misconception about the health of the Miniature Shar Pei is that its wrinkles lead to skin problems. A healthy dog's wrinkles should not require any special care. The wrinkles can cause other issues, occasionally puppies have so many wrinkles that the excess skin covers the dogs eyes and puts pressure on the eyelids causing them to rub on the cornea. This symptom is called entropion and can usually be corrected through a process called ""tacking"" where by using stitches to temporarily hold the wrinkles away from the eyes, the puppy is given time to grow into its skin. In severe cases where tacking is unsuccessful, an operation may be needed to surgically remove the excess skin around the dogs eyes. Like the larger Standard Shar Pei, Swollen Hocks Syndrome is sometimes seen in this breed and if not treated can lead to Amyloidosis resulting in Kidney Failure. Other than these few issues the breed tends to be relatively healthy requiring only routine visits to the vet.</div> <div></div> <div> &nbsp; [button link=""http://alphamatch.com/listing-type/pets/?pet-type=1081&amp;breed-2=1035"" color=""black"" type=""big-button"" type=""Search for Miniature Shar Pei""]Search for Miniature Shar Pei[/button] &nbsp; </div> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div> &nbsp;",NULL,NULL,NULL,"Y","0"

Mastiff-type dogs are often referred to as Molossus dogs or <b>Molossers</b>. It is one of the best-known breeds of Greco-Roman antiquity; however, its physical characteristics and function are debated. Though the Molossus breed no longer exists in its original form, it is noted as being instrumental in the development of modern breeds such as the St. Bernard, Great Pyrenees,Rottweiler, Great Dane, Newfoundland, Greater Swiss Mountain Dog, Bernese Mountain Dog, and the Cane Corso. Some scholars contend that the Molossus was a dog used by the Ancient Greeks for fighting. They describe it as having a wide, short muzzle and a heavy dewlap (similar to modern Mastiff breeds) that was used to fight tigers, lions, elephants, and men in battle. A Roman copy of a Greek original sculpture of a guard dog (known as the Jennings Dog) is generally considered to represent a Molossus and can be seen at the British Museum. Others argue that it was primarily a lightweight dog used for hunting and herding with physical characteristics more akin to Greyhounds or possibly the American Pit Bull Terrier. Most scholars agree the Molossus originated with the Molossis people in the mountainous regions of north west Ancient Greece and southern Albania before the Common Era). The Molossians were renowned for their vicious hounds, which were used by Molossian shepherds of Epirus<sup id=""cite_ref-5"">[5]</sup> in the mountains of northwestern Greece to guard their flocks. The poet Grattius, a contemporary of Ovid, writes ""...when serious work has come, when bravery must be shown, and the impetuous War-god calls in the utmost hazard, then you could not but admire the renowned Molossians so much.""<sup>[<i>citation needed</i>]</sup> The breed was a native to Greece and the rest of the Balkans, and later migrated to Italy and other places of the Greek World by Hellenic tribes who started to colonize in various regions of the world. Virgil says that in ancient Greece the heavier Molossian dogs were often used by the Greeks and Romans for hunting (canis venaticus) and to watch over the house and livestock (canis pastoralis). ""Never, with them on guard,"" says Virgil, ""need you fear for your stalls a midnight thief, or onslaught of wolves, or Iberian brigands at your back."" Aristotle mentions them in the history of animals and praises their bravery and physical superiority.

The Moscow Water Dog was produced only by the Red Star Kennels, the state operated organization chartered to provide working dogs for the armed services. After World War II, there were very few working dogs in the Soviet Union as many had been killed during the war. Some were imported but there were not enough to establish a dedicated breeding programme for a specific breed. The Central Military School of Working Dogs (the Red Star Kennels), under the command of Colonel G. P. Medvedev began working on developing a number of their own specialised breeds by crossing the available stock. A few breeds were established including the Moscow Newfoundland, a cross of German Shepherd Dog and Newfoundland; the Moscow Great Dane, using German Shepherd and Great Dane; the Brudasty Hound, which was an Airedale Terrier and Russian Hound mix; the Moscow Watchdog, a combination of St. Bernard and Caucasian Ovcharka; and the Moscow Water Dog. The most successful breed to come out of the programme was the Russian Black Terrier, which gained international recognition in 1984; it derived from a combination of 14 different breeds including the Moscow Water Dog in the later stages of its development. Moscow Water Dogs were bred in Krasnaya Zvezda, Belarus, by interbreeding Newfoundland males with East European Shepherd and Caucasian Ovcharka females, and by mating the offspring with each other.

The vernacular name ""Karwani,"" from the Farsi ""karwan,"" endures to this day in the villages, but it was anglicized to Caravan Hound when the Kennel Club of India recognized the breed. The name for the feathered variety comes from the Farsi ""Pashm,"" meaning soft, silky, wool-like. &nbsp; <h3>Temperament</h3> The breed is above all a working hound, capable of providing an excellent performance in the field on a consistent basis, under gruelling conditions that would decimate most other dogs. They are elegant, graceful and courageous. Its physical strength couples with great speed and plenty of stamina to allow it to catch and kill several types of game, from hare to blackbuck, over rough country. It is not an ideal dog for the apartment dweller, as it needs a great deal of space and exercise; although if arrangements are made to exercise the dog regularly in a sufficiently large, safely fenced area, it may do well in a flat or any other dwelling. The breed, if treated with kindness and respect, can be exceptionally loyal. They are not very friendly, and do not like to be touched by strangers. However, a Caravan should never be aggressive, as this sort of temperament is not ideal for a hunting dog, which must tolerate other dogs and human beings, especially when they are not intruding on his territory.

Despite centuries of popularity throughout Europe, this type of dog was almost lost after World War II. Soon after the war, Italian painter Piero Scanziani established a breeding kennel to turn the mastiff-type dogs of Italy into a formal breed which was then named the Neapolitan Mastiff and English Mastiff was used to help in this process. A Neapolitan Mastiff has set the record for giving birth to 24 puppies, although 4 of them didn't survive. Neapolitan Mastiffs were also trained to bait bulls, bears and jaguars &nbsp; <h3>Temperament</h3> The Neapolitan Mastiff is a loyal companion to its home and family. They prefer to be with their family by staying around the home outside at all times sleeping, which is their natural instinct. The Neapolitan Mastiff rarely barks unless under provocation. Neapolitan Mastiffs, as a breed, are extremely intelligent dogs with a tendency to be independent thinkers. They learn quickly, which is both good and bad, since this breed needs extensive proper socialization to learn to accept strangers, especially within the home; with proper early socialization and training, these dogs rarely become aggressive towards strangers or unfamiliar dogs. As with every breed, obediencetraining is very important. The Neo is very tolerant of pain due to the fact the skin is loose on the body, so it is important to routinely check for health problems, as a Neo may not behave differently when injured or ill. They also are renowned for drooling especially after drinking or if they get excited. &nbsp; [button link=""http://alphamatch.com/listing-type/pets/?pet-type=1081&amp;breed-2=1035"" color=""black"" type=""big-button"" type=""Search for Neapolitan Mastiff""]Search for Neapolitan Mastiff[/button] &nbsp; &nbsp;",NULL,NULL,NULL,"Y","0"

In fact, many St. Bernard Dogs have Newfoundland Dog ancestry. Newfoundlands were brought and introduced to the St. Bernard breed in the 18th century when the population was threatened by an epidemic of distemper. They share many characteristics of many mountain dog breeds such as the Great Pyrenees. The Newfoundland breed originated in Newfoundland, and is descended from a breed indigenous to the island known as the lesser Newfoundland, or St. John's Dog. The mastiff characteristics of the Newfoundland are likely a result of breeding with Portuguese Mastiffs brought to the island by Portuguese fishermen beginning in the 16th century. The speculation that Newfoundlands may be partly descended from big black bear dogs introduced by the Vikings in 1001 A.Dis based more in romance than in fact. By the time colonization was permitted in Newfoundland in 1610, the distinct physical characteristics and mental attributes had been established in the Newfoundland breed. In the early 1880s, fishermen and explorers from Ireland and England traveled to the Grand Banks of Newfoundland, where they described two main types of working dog. One was heavily built, large with a longish coat, and the other medium-sized in build ? an active, smooth-coated water dog. The heavier breed was known as the Greater Newfoundland, or Newfoundland. The smaller breed was known as the Lesser Newfoundland, or St. John's Dog. The St. John's Dog became the founding breed of the modern retrievers. Both breeds were used as working dogs to pull fish nets, with the Greater Newfoundland also being used to haul carts and other equipment, because of that, they were part of the foundation stock of the Leonberger (which excelled at water rescue and was imported by the Canadian government for that purpose); and the now extinct Moscow Water Dog, a failed attempt at creating a lifesaving dog by the Russian state kennel?the unfortunate outcross with the Caucasian Ovcharka begat a biting and not a rescuing dog. Many tales have been told of the courage displayed by Newfoundlands in adventuring and lifesaving exploits. Over the last two centuries, this has inspired a number of artists, who have portrayed the dogs in paint, stone, bronze and porcelain. One famous Newfoundland was a dog named Seaman, who accompanied American explorers Lewis and Clark on their expedition. The breed's working role was varied and another famous all black Newfoundland performed as the star attraction in Van Hare's Magic Circus from 1862 and for many years thereafter in one England's founding circus acts, traveling throughout Europe. The circus dog was known as the ""Thousand Guinea Dog Napoleon"" or ""Napoleon the Wonder Dog"". Van Hare trained other Newfoundland dogs to perform a steeplechase routine, with baboons dressed up as jockeys to ride them. Nonetheless, his ""wizard dog"" Napoleon was his favorite and would compete at jumping against human rivals, leaping over horses from a springboard, and dancing to music.<sup id=""cite_ref-10""></sup><sup id=""cite_ref-11""><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newfoundland_(dog)#cite_note-11""> </a></sup> The breed prospered in the United Kingdom, until 1914 and again in 1939, when its numbers were almost fatally depleted by wartime restrictions.

The Newfoundland's extremely large bones give it mass, while its large musculature gives it the power it needs to take on rough ocean waves and powerful tides. These dogs have great lung capacity for swimming extremely long distances, and a thick, oily and waterproof double coat which protects them from the chill of icy waters. The droopy lips and jowls make the dog drool. In the water, the dog's massive webbed paws give it maximum propulsion. The swimming stroke is not an ordinary dog paddle. Unlike other dogs, the Newfoundland moves its limbs in a down-and-out motion, which can be seen as a modified breaststroke. This gives it more power with every stroke. &nbsp; <h3>Temperament</h3> The Newfoundland dog is legendary for its calm and docile nature and its strength. They are highly loyal and make ideal working dogs. It is for this reason that this breed is known as ""the gentle giant"". International kennel clubs generally describe the breed as having a sweet temper. It typically has a deep bark, and is easy to train if started young. They are wonderfully good with children, but because of their size at a very young age, small children could get accidentally leaned on and knocked down<i>.</i> The Newfoundland in general is good with other animals, but their size can create problems if not trained.

However, later historians disagree with this theory, saying that the Duke of Norfolk's spaniels were of the King Charles type and that terrier stock had nothing to do with the origins of the Norfolk Spaniel. The theory of the Duke of Norfolk-based origins of the Norfolk Spaniel was thought disproved by the investigation of James Farrow, a 19th-century spaniel breeder, who wrote to Henry Fitzalan-Howard, 15th Duke of Norfolk in order to find out the truth about the origins of the breed. The Duke responded, denying any connection to the breed, although he did state that his grandfather, Henry Howard, 13th Duke of Norfolk, owned Sussex Spaniels. The letter from the Duke was printed in <i>The Kennel Gazette</i> in 1899. An alternative origin was proposed by Rawdon Briggs Lee in volume two of his 1897 work <i>A History and Description of the Modern Dogs of Great Britain and Ireland</i>. Lee argued that the Norfolk Spaniel was descended from a crossing of a curly-coated water spaniel and a Sussex Spaniel or another strain of land spaniel.<sup id=""cite_ref-lee304_4-0""><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norfolk_Spaniel#cite_note-lee304-4""> </a></sup> In the 18th century, spaniels were split into three categories: land spaniels, water spaniels and toy spaniels. The land spaniels were split into two further types, the cocker spaniel and the springer spaniel. It was within the springer spaniel type that the Norfolk Spaniel was placed, along with the Sussex Spaniel and the Clumber Spaniel. By the 1860s, the breed was described as the ""commonest breed in England"", but with a description that varies so much that the only standard point is that they averaged 16 inches (41 cm) in height at the withers. The Spaniel Club was formed in 1885, and issued a breed standard for the Norfolk Spaniel, recognising it as a variety of spaniel. However, the general public saw it only as a generic land spaniel. By the 1890s, the breed had become common throughout the counties of England, leading dog writers such as Rawdon Briggs Lee to question the authenticity of its origins, or that the various liver and white spaniels from around England constituted a single breed; ""Personally, I do not consider the liver and white spaniel any particular variety at all, nor do I believe that it has ever been indigenous to Norfolk."" He states that similar dogs exist in Devonshire that do not trace ancestry to Norfolk, and that liver and white spaniels pre-date the breeding of the Black and Tan Terrier with an ordinary spaniel. F.H.F. Mercer described the breed in 1890 as being ""virtually extinct in its purity"", with its liver and white colours running through any numbers of miscellaneous spaniels, and he too discredits the origins involving the Duke of Norfolk.<sup id=""cite_ref-mercer24_10-1""><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norfolk_Spaniel#cite_note-mercer24-10""> </a></sup> The Kennel Club (UK) designated all medium legged spaniels which were not Clumber nor Sussex Spaniels as English Springer Spaniels in 1902. The Norfolk Spaniel was included under this designation, with the term ""Norfolk Spaniel"" considered for use to cover these types of spaniels, but ultimately rejected as the Club believed that the breed was always liver and white in colour. The change in terminology was not smooth or immediate, with James Watson in his 1905 work, <i>The Dog Book</i>, still referring to the Norfolk Spaniel as a breed name. In the modern era, the Norfolk Spaniel is thought to be the previous name for the English Springer Spaniel, prior to recognition by The Kennel Club (UK).<sup id=""cite_ref-13""><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norfolk_Spaniel#cite_note-13""> </a></sup> &nbsp; <h2>Appearance</h2> <div></div> The breed was a freckled white dog with either liver or black markings, the breed standard in 1859 set their measurements at 17?18 inches (43?46 cm) in height at the withers. It had long legs, feathered ears, a white area on forehead, which was said to ""[add] a great deal to his beauty"", but there were differences from the English Springer, including a broader skull and shorter neck. It was also compared to the English Setter in its build, shape, and proportions, although it was a much smaller size. While other field spaniels of this era displayed colours other than liver and white or liver and black, the Norfolk did not. The breed-specific qualities varied greatly as in some places the breeding lines were not kept particularly pure, those lines having had stock from Sussex and Clumber Spaniels bred into them.<sup id=""cite_ref-stonehenge109_16-2""><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norfolk_Spaniel#cite_note-stonehenge109-16""> </a></sup> By the end of the 19th century the description of a Norfolk Spaniel had changed slightly, The Spaniel Club breed standard for a Norfolk Spaniel in 1897 was for the animal to have a coat of either black and white or liver and white which was not curly, a reasonably heavy body and legs which are longer than other field spaniels but shorter than the Irish Water Spaniel, a deep chest with long sloping shoulders and strength in the back and loins, as well as features typical of a spaniel such as lobular ears. This standard also included the requirement for the tail to be docked. In brief, the standard described the Norfolk as simply looking like a large cocker spaniel.<sup id=""cite_ref-watson269_21-0""><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norfolk_Spaniel#cite_note-watson269-21""> </a></sup> &nbsp; <h2>Temperament</h2> The Norfolk Spaniel would typically be uhappy when they were separated from their owners, as they formed a strong attachment. Compared to the springer spaniels of the 19th century, they were more ill-tempered, and could be headstrong and wilful if not successfully broken. Some members of the breed could be noisy, and were described as ""babbling"" and making noise on the hunt in a similar fashion to hounds, while others were far quieter.<sup id=""cite_ref-lee304_4-2""><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norfolk_Spaniel#cite_note-lee304-4""> </a></sup> Its use in hunting was varied, and the breed was useful both on land and in the water.

The Norwich Terrier and later the drop-eared variety now known as the Norfolk Terrier, were believed to have been developed by crossing local terrier-like dogs, small, short-legged Irish Terrier breeds and the small red terriers used by the Gypsy ratters of Norfolk (the county in which Norwich the city exists). They were first called the <b>Cantab Terrier</b> when they became fashionable for students to keep in their rooms at Cambridge University in England. Later, they were called the <b>Trumpington Terrier</b>, after Trumpington Street where the breed was further developed at a livery stable. Then, just prior to World War I, a prominent Irish horse rider Frank Jones sold quantities of the short-legged terriers to the USA, so there they were called <b>Jones Terriers</b>. It was Jones who designated the terriers were from Norwich.<sup id=""cite_ref-Read20_6-1""><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norfolk_Terrier#cite_note-Read20-6""> </a></sup> In 1932, the Norwich was granted acceptance into the English Kennel Club and the first written standard was created. The American Kennel Club registered the first Norwich Terrier in 1936. In 1964, The Kennel Club reclassified the drop-ear variety as it its own breed, the Norfolk Terrier, and the prick-eared variety retained the name Norwich Terrier. The American Kennel Club and Canadian Kennel Club both recognized the division of the Norwich Terrier breed in 1979. The Norfolk Terrier was recognized by the United KennelClub in 1979. After many generations, these two breeds have developed as two distinct breeds both in physical looks and in temperament. Of note, there is literature that suggests that the Norfolk and Norwich were always two distinct breeds and the original mistake was classifying them as one &nbsp; <h3>Temperament</h3> Norfolks are described as fearless, but can be aggressive. They, along with Norwich Terriers and Border Terriers, have the softest temperaments of the Terrier Group. Norfolks work in packs and must get along with other dogs. As companions, they love people and children and do make good pets. Their activity level is generally reflective of the pace of their environment. This breed should not be kept or live outside since they thrive on human contact. Generally, Norfolks are not given to digging but, like any dog, will dig out of boredom when left alone for too long a period. Norfolks can be barkers and are very vocal. They generally cohabit well with other household pets when introduced as a puppy. Outdoors, they are natural hunters with a strong prey drive for small vermin. Norfolks are self-confident and carry themselves with presence and importance, holding their heads and tails erect. A Norfolk that is shy or that carries its tail between its legs is atypical, as it is hot-tempered and aggressive with other dogs; these traits are not the standard. A Norfolk's typical temperament is happy, spirited, and self-confident. <h4>Working style</h4> Norfolks were originally bred as barn dogs to rid the barn of vermin. Some literature suggest that they were also occasionally used on the hunt to bolt animals of equal size from their den. To some extent they are still used in that capacity in continental Europe. Norfolks are pack animals and hence expected to get along with other dogs while working or in the home. As a pack dog, they take turns working their prey. They are fearless and their courage is incredible. Today, of course, they are household companions and must have an agreeable disposition for living with people. &nbsp; <h3>Appearance</h3> The Norfolk Terrier has a wire-haired coat which, according to the various national kennel clubs' breed standards, can be ""all shades of red, wheaten, black and tan, or grizzle.""<sup id=""cite_ref-Canadian_KC_standard_1-0""><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norfolk_Terrier#cite_note-Canadian_KC_standard-1""> </a></sup> They are the smallest of the working terriers. They are active and compact, free moving, with good substance and bone. Good substance means good spring of rib and bone that matches the body such that the dog can be a very agile ratter or earth-dog. Norfolk terriers are moderately proportioned dogs. A too heavy dog would not be agile. A too refined dog would make it a toy breed. Norfolks generally have more reach and drive and a stronger rear angulation, hence cover more ground than their Norwich cousins. Norfolk have good side gait owed to their balanced angulation front and rear and their slightly longer length of back. The ideal height is 9 to 10 in (23 to 25 cm) at the withers and weight is about 11 to 12 lb (5.0 to 5.4 kg).<sup id=""cite_ref-2""><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norfolk_Terrier#cite_note-2""> </a></sup> &nbsp; <h2>Health</h2> The life expectancy of a Norfolk Terrier is 8?14 years, with some growing as old as 17 years. Norfolks do have incidences of mitral valve disease, luxating patellas, and incorrect bites (where the teeth do not align with the breed standard, i.e. overshot or undershot). Norfolks most often have shallow hip sockets and many breedlines are dysplastic. There has never been a Norfolk Terrier recognized by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) as having ""excellent"" rated hips. Therefore responsible breeders are testing for hip dysplasia. Breeders that do not radiograph hips and have them evaluated by either OFA or PennHip, cannot answer questions regarding hip dysplasia in their breeding program. Norfolks generally have medium to small litters. Responsible breeders only breed healthy dogs who are of good temperament, good pedigree lineage and best reflect the breed standard. The demand for Norfolk is far greater than the supply. The environment in which they are raised directly impacts the temperament of the puppy for its lifetime. &nbsp; [button link=""http://alphamatch.com/listing-type/pets/?pet-type=1081&amp;breed-2=1035"" color=""black"" type=""big-button"" type=""Search for Norfolk Terrier""]Search for Norfolk Terrier[/button]",NULL,NULL,NULL,"Y","0"

Sweden and Finland argue about the true home of the Norrbottenspets, but clearly the dog has spent much time in both countries. The dogs were mainly used as hunting companions. By the end of World War I, the Norbottenspets came close to extinction. Due to the very small number of norrbottens, Sweden closed its studbook in 1948. Although some dogs were preserved, they were in a non-Swedish speaking area and in the far north as a farm dog and companion. Enthusiasts sought out the few remaining dogs and started a successful breeding program between the 1950s and early 1960s. FCI confirmed a new breed standard in 1966 and the official name was confirmed as Norrbottenspets. In 1967 the Swedish Kennel Club accepted the breed for registration and a new standard was written. Finland accepted the standard and began registering dogs in 1973. In Finland these dogs are called Pohjanpystykorva. Immigrant farmers have given the dog an even longer name, Norbottens-skollandehund. There is a great effort in Finland to ensure the health of these fox-like hunting dogs and breeding is highly controlled. Healthy animals, that are only distantly related, are being bred with careful consideration of breeding consultants to create a strong background. Sweden has also had a dramatic impact on the preservation of this breed through strict breeding practices. &nbsp; <h3>Appearance</h3> The Norrbottenspets should be a light spitz dog, yet powerful in appearance. There should be lightness and power reflected in the dog. Males are noticeably more masculine than females, who are smaller and of lighter build. It should give the impression of being alert, spritely, and intelligent. In proportions the Norrbottenspets is slightly taller than long - fit for the original use as a hunter. The tail should curl over the back and rest on the hips. The Norrbottenspets is a physical mixture of endurance, speed, and strength. The ribcage has elements of both speed and strength. Viewed from the front the ribcage is oval and relatively deep, half from height. The ribcage is also relatively long with well-developed last ribs. The arched neck, distinguishable withers and slightly slanting croup makes the lines of the body very speedy. The underline has only a slight tuck up, which with the long ribcage reflects endurance. Viewing the legs one can see both elements of speed and endurance. The relatively slanting shoulder blades, long upper arms and strong back angulations reflect endurance. The upper thigh forms a nearly 90 degree angle with the pelvis. Small, tight paws belong to an endurance trotter, but relatively long hocks add to the speed in gallop, especially in the start. Although rare, bobtails do occur naturally, as in the Finnish Spitz and Karelian Bear Dog. This is an automatic disqualification for the showring for the Finnish Spitz and the Norrbottenspets, but not the Karelian. The hunting dog does not need a tail to be very efficient. &nbsp; [button link=""http://alphamatch.com/listing-type/pets/?pet-type=1081&amp;breed-2=1035"" color=""black"" type=""big-button"" type=""Search for Norrbottenspets""]Search for Norrbottenspets[/button]",NULL,NULL,NULL,"Y","0"

The exact date of its extinction is not known; it is likely that it was gradually interbred with other breeds, particularly the modern Beagle, until the genuine North Country Beagle bloodline ceased to exist. The origins of the North Country Beagle are equally unclear. Most writers suggest that it was developed from the Talbot, whose origins are also uncertain, but which some have claimed originated in Normandy. The Talbot was a predominantly white, slow, deep-throated, scent hound. At some point the Talbots were crossed with Greyhounds to give them an extra turn of speed, but they remained comparatively slow dogs that relied more on their nose than speed in the chase.<sup id=""cite_ref-1""> </sup> The North Country Beagle was a large, bony hound with a square head, and long trailing ears. Chiefly bred in Yorkshire, it was common in the north of England, but below the River Trent the similar Southern Hound was more abundant. The North Country Beagle was a faster dog; in <i>The British Encyclopedia</i> of 1809, William Nicholson says that the North Country Beagle was kept by the ""dashing class of sportsman"" because it could ""run down a brace [of hare] before dinner"", but although a good scent hound, was probably lacking in this ability when compared to the delicate nose of the Southern Hound. Both the North Country Beagle and Southern Hound seem to have fallen out of favour during the 18th century as the fashion for less time consuming hunts led to the development of the faster Foxhound. The North Country Beagle may have formed part of the packs kept by southern farmers for rabbit-hunting that would eventually became the nucleus for the modern Beagle breed. Stonehenge says that packs of hounds that resembled the description of the North Country Beagle still existed in Wales, Devon, Yorkshire and Sussex during the 19th century, but he was doubtful as to how far any of these packs truly represented any of the three early hound breeds.<sup id=""cite_ref-Stone_3-2""> </sup> Aside from the Beagle other modern hound breeds are believed to have North Country Beagle blood: Harriers and Foxhounds among others.

There are many variations in size, coat and color among the Spitz breeds. In the ancient Gokstad excavation in Norway, where a Viking grave from about the year 900 was opened, skeletons from six dogs of various sizes were found. They would be the antecedents of modern-day Buhunds. When Vikings died, their most cherished and necessary possessions were buried alongside their owners. This was to care for the Vikings in their afterlife. The dogs that protected farms and herded cattle and sheep were expected to continue these duties in Valhalla. It has been documented that these dogs travelled with Vikings on their many journeys, by sea and by land.<sup id=""cite_ref-5""><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_Buhund#cite_note-5""> </a></sup> &nbsp; <h3>Temperament</h3> The Norwegian Buhund is a highly cheerful and active breed. They do not tire easily and require extensive exercise on a daily basis. The Norwegian Buhund needs to expel its energy and becomes destructive and ill-mannered if ignored or made to stay still frequently. In conjunction with their high level of activity and energy, they are also extremely lovable and are known for their love of children. However, due to their high level of energy and need for intensive training, Norwegian Buhunds should always be supervised, especially around children and the elderly. This breed loves to cuddle and give kisses to their masters and families. They form strong bonds with their owners and therefore are natural watch dogs. This can result in aloof behavior and wariness or anxiety around strangers. New owners may find this problematic, since the Norwegian Buhund may bark at each new alarming noise or movement. They are communicative and brave, but rarely will snap or bite without provocation. The Norwegian Buhund is highly intelligent. They are extremely headstrong and demonstrate an intense desire to be taught and to learn new things. If appropriate stimulus is not made available, the breed may resort to destructive or inappropriate behavior. The Buhund breed does become bored easily and is known to become restless. Daily exercise is required. This breed is ideal for owners who can dedicate time to exercise and training. With this desire for activity and learning combined with a high level of energy, the Norwegian Buhund makes an excellent agility dog. People who live active lifestyles, or are seeking a dog with which they can become involved in dog sports, will appreciate the personality of the Norwegian Buhund. It is also an ideal dog for people who are athletic and desire a dog to go running, hiking or biking with. This breed makes an excellent companion for a sports enthusiast.<sup id=""cite_ref-4""><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_Buhund#cite_note-4""> </a></sup> &nbsp; [button link=""http://alphamatch.com/listing-type/pets/?pet-type=1081&amp;breed-2=1035"" color=""black"" type=""big-button"" type=""Search for Norwegian Buhund""]Search for Norwegian Buhund[/button] &nbsp; &nbsp;",NULL,NULL,NULL,"Y","0"

The dogs were useful as ratters in the stable yard, bolters of fox for the hunt, and family companions. It was the mascot ofCambridge students. Small red terriers, descendants of Irish Terriers, had existed in the area since at least the 1860s, and these might be the ancestors of the Norwich, or it might have come from the Trumpington Terrier, a breed that no longer exists. In its earliest history, it was also known as the <i>Jones Terrier</i> and the <i>Cantab Terrier</i>.<sup id=""cite_ref-Read_7-1""> </sup> Since its earliest identification as a breed, puppies have had either drop or prick ears, and both were allowed when the Norwich was first recognized in the show ring in 1932 by The Kennel Club (England). Drop ears were often croppeduntil it became illegal to do so. This intensified a long-standing controversy over whether drop-eared dogs should be allowed in the show ring and whether the primary difference was simply the ears or whether other, deeper, personality and structural differences marked the drop-eared variety. Starting in the 1930s, breeders increased their efforts to distinguish the breeds. While Norfolk and Norwich Terriers were inter-bred for a number of years today they are positively two distinctive breeds. In fact some historical texts indicate that they were distinctive breeds before they were inter-bred. Both ear types continued to be allowed in the ring until The Kennel Club recognized the drop-eared variety as a separate breed, the Norfolk Terrier, in 1964, and the American Kennel Club, United Kennel Club, and Canadian Kennel Clubdid the same in 1979. Until that time, the breeds were designated by the AKC as Norwich Terriers, P.E. (prick ears) and Norwich Terriers, D.E. (drop ears). &nbsp; <h3>Temperament</h3> These small but hardy dogs can be courageous, intelligent and affectionate. They can be assertive but it is not typical for them to be aggressive, quarrelsome or shy. They are energetic and thrive on an active life. They are also quite hungry all the time and will eat anything edible. They are eager to please but have definite minds of their own. They are sensitive to scolding but 100% Terrier. They should not usually be kept outside or in a kennel setting because they enjoy the companionship of their owners. Norwich are not given to unnecessary barking, but they will warn of a stranger approaching. Once they realize that there is no threat, they can become immediate friends. Norwich are generally good with children, and if introduced to other household pets as a puppy they generally co-habit peacefully, though caution should be observed around rodent pets as they may be mistaken for prey. &nbsp; <h2>Health</h2> US and UK breed surveys put the life expectancy of the Norwich Terrier at 13?13.5 years. While the Norwich Terrier is considered a healthy breed, there are some health issues for which responsible breeders do preventative genetic health testing, thereby reducing the incidences. The Norwich Terrier does have a predisposition for some health issues but studies to determine the exact mode of inheritance or the exact frequency in the breed are unknown or have not been conclusive. At present there are no disorders identified as ""most important"". Of secondary magnitude,cataracts are recognized as a disorder that has been reported sporadically and may be inherited. Also of a secondary magnitude there are instances of epilepsy, narrow tracheas, luxating patellas, hip dysplasia, mitral valve disease, [atopy|atopy(allergic inhalant dermatitis)] and incorrect bites (how the teeth meet when the jaws are closed). Like all dogs, Norwich Terriers can have autoimmune reactivity to rabies vaccinations. Rabies-Vaccine-Induced Ischemic Dermatopathy, or RVI-ID, is a non-fatal but potentially serious reaction to chemicals called adjuvants in the vaccine. RVI-ID is often misdiagnosed, but if correctly diagnosed, is treatable. Symptoms may include: symmetrical dark spots or lesions at the tips of the ears; swelling, hard lumps or dark spots in the vicinity of the injection site. Higher volume Norwich breeders are seeing more dogs with breathing concerns, and the Norwich and Norfolk Terrier Club (USA) has formed a new ""Health and Genetics Sub-Committee for Research on Upper Airway Syndrome in Norwich Terriers"". Upper Airway Syndrome (UAS) covers all abnormalities that can occur in the upper airway, including: elongated soft palates; too short soft palates; narrow/misshapen tracheas; collapsing tracheas; stenotic nares (nasal passages that are too small); swollen tonsils; everted laryngeal saccules. These upper airway disorders can occur singly or in combination with one or two others. All compromise the airway and the dog's ability to breathe normally; the dog's breathing often sounds raspy or moist. It may be that shorter muzzles may have increased incidence of such issues. Norwich Terriers generally have small litters of 1 to 3 puppies. Generally, if a female is healthy, its optimal breeding period is between the ages of 2 (after all genetic health testing is complete - heart, eyes, hips and patellas) and six years. At seven years of age dogs are considered geriatric. The small supply and the high price of a purebred Norwich Terrier - often around US$2,500 in 2008 - has attracted fraud, as unsuspecting buyers pay full price for Cairn Terrierswith docked tails, or mixed-breed puppies. &nbsp; [button link=""http://alphamatch.com/listing-type/pets/?pet-type=1081&amp;breed-2=1035"" color=""black"" type=""big-button"" type=""Search for   Norwich Terrier""]Search for Norwich Terrier[/button]",NULL,NULL,NULL,"Y","0"

The breed was originally known as the Little River Duck Dog or the Yarmouth Toller. Its exact origins are not known but it appears that some possibly spaniel and setter-type dogs, retriever-type dogs, and farm collie may have gone into the mix. It may share origins with the smallerKooikerhondje, which has a similar method of work.<sup id=""cite_ref-4""> </sup> The Toller was officially admitted to the Canadian Kennel Club in 1945. Declared the provincial dog of Nova Scotia in 1955, the breed gained national recognition in 1980, when two Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retrievers were awarded Best in Show at championship events that included many breeds.

Some dogs may be reserved in new situations but shyness in adult dogs is considered a flaw.<sup id=""cite_ref-10""> </sup> Duck Tollers are working animals and are happiest when they have a job to do. Tollers are excellent hunting companions. They excel at many types of sporting competitions, such as agility, dock diving and obedience. Their keen sense of smell, intelligence, working drive, and small size, also make them perfect search and rescue dogs.<sup id=""cite_ref-15""> </sup> Physical stimulation should be provided for these dogs each day since they may become destructive when they are not exercised enough or left alone for too long.

This recent (Bauer &amp; Lemo, December 2008) report containing a record of a preserved nucleus of a regional Old World sighthound, the <i>hrt</i>, or Old Croatian sighthound, is a notable cynological and veterinary contribution to sighthound history. It is one more confirmation of the mechanism behind the extinction of sighthound varieties, where the loss of ""aristocratic"", landed hunting rights (pursued mainly by horse, and hound) gave place to ""universal"", licensed hunting rights (pursued mainly on foot, by gun) which tended to literally outlaw sighthounds. Sighthounds, which by definition require large open tracts of land, became an object of suspected poaching, and were often actively persecuted. Consequently the regional and national varieties, which for ages had been prolific across Europe, were eradicated or allowed to die out. The Chort, Magyar Agar and Chart, for example escaped this fate, the Frisian sighthound did not.

The local farmers called their farmdogsBloodhounds, but it seems more likely that these hounds were offspring from the Squire?s scent hounds, which in turn were descended primarily from St. Hubert Hounds. Likewise it is probable that the gypsy dogs generally descended from Spanish Pointing Dogs and other breeds of scent hounds, so in many ways St.Hubert Hounds have contributed to the Old Danish Pointer. &nbsp; <h3>Temperament</h3> Conveys the impression of a quiet and stable dog showing determination and courage. During the hunt, the dog progresses rather slowly, always maintaining contact with the hunter and accomplishing its task as a pointing dog without creating unnecessary disturbance of the ground. The breed is suited for small as well as large hunting grounds. The name has nothing to do with temperament, but refers to its ability to point out birds of the order Galliformes and specifically birds belonging to the family Phasianidae. Commonly referred to in Danish as Hen birds/Chicken birds. The often used English name, ""Old Danish Chicken Dog"" is therefore incorrect or at best badly translated.

They are on the list of Vulnerable Native Breeds as identified by the UK Kennel Club, and great efforts are being made to save the breed.<sup id=""cite_ref-panda_10-0""></sup><sup id=""cite_ref-11""> </sup> &nbsp; <h2>Health</h2> The average lifespan of the breed is a little over 10 years. A quarter will live 12 to 15 years. At least one hound is known to have lived to be 16 years old. The Otterhound enjoys considerable exercise, but can also be a couch potato. They can be good family dogs but need to be kept in a secure property since they can jump fences up to 5 feet high. In spite of the small gene pool, the Otterhound is generally a healthy breed, but is subject to many of the same complaints as all large, rapidly growing dogs. Common problems that can occur are elbow and hip dysplasia, a malformation of the hip and elbow joints. They are not always painful, but can cause lameness and impair mobility. It can also result in arthritis. Badly affected hounds should not be bred from, but most Otterhounds have a poor hip and elbow score. The problem can be reduced by making sure that young Otterhounds do not jump down from high places, go up and down the stairs or walk too much on very hard surfaces while bones are still growing. this enables the muscles around the sockets to strengthen and develop, providing more support. Otterhounds can also be subject to ear infections, due to the shape of their ears, and bloat, or gastric torsion, due to their deep chest. Epilepsy and seizures are also known to affect the breed, and can be hereditary. There is ongoing research into the causes of epilepsy in Otterhounds. For reasons currently unknown, epilepsy in Otterhounds in the United States does not appear to be fatal, while epilepsy found Otterhounds from the United Kingdom is frequently untreatable, and is usually fatal. &nbsp; [button link=""http://alphamatch.com/listing-type/pets/?pet-type=1081&amp;breed-2=1035"" color=""black"" type=""big-button"" type=""Search for  Otterhound""]Search for Otterhound[/button]",NULL,NULL,NULL,"Y","0"

The breed was primarily a pet, and it was also a popular showdog. In 1903, the breed is referred to as ""a fancier's dog, a sport from the Skye Terrier stock"" and despite some fanciers of the time claiming that the breed had the ""hardiness and fitness for terrier work... it is evident that a dog with a coat that looks like silk is simply a toy."" Owners and breeders in the 1800s placed a high value on the beautiful blue and tan coat, and would cover the dog's feet and tie the hair back over their eyes to keep the coat looking at its best for dog shows.<sup id=""cite_ref-Lee1894_2-3""> </sup> The Kennel Club recognised the Paisley Terrier in 1888 as a variety of the Skye Terrier, even though separate show classes had been held for the two types in 1887. However, there were so few entries that the Kennel Club did not continue to encourage offering the category at further exhibitions.<sup id=""cite_ref-Lee1894_2-4""> </sup> The breed's success as a showdog may have led to its decline. Judges would give awards to the dogs with the long, attractive coat, since length of coat was a principal factor in Skye Terriers. The Paisleys, bred for long but soft coats (useless for a working dog), would win the prizes. Skye Terrier fanciers objected to the type being shown with Skyes, since they considered the Paisleys to be mixed breeds or possibly crossed with Dandie Dinmonts. The interest of fanciers declined and breed began to disappear.<sup id=""cite_ref-Lee1894_2-5""> </sup> A book published in 1918 describes Paisley Terriers as uncommon and ""I doubt that you'll ever see one in the United States."" But with the availability of internet based dog registries that will register breeds with little or no documentation, combined with the public's appetite for unique or ""rare"" pets, it is likely that there will be attempts to reconstitute the breed. &nbsp; <h2>Appearance</h2> The appearance of the Paisley terrier was similar to the Skye Terrier, but was shorter backed and weighed around 7 kg (16 lbs), about half the weight of today's Skye Terrier. The breed had a flowing ""silvery, soft jacket"" (coat) of blue and tan, and was shown along with the hard-coated Skye Terriers. They were further described as having a great profusion of silky fur with very profuse ear feathering (long hair on the ears.) To differentiate it from the Skye, it was nicknamed the <i>Silky</i>. From the earliest time of the breed, the beauty of the coat won prizes at dog shows. Traditionally, the dogs were shown standing on a box, so that the length of the silky coat could be shown to its best advantage.<sup id=""cite_ref-Clark.26Brace_1-1""> </sup> The Paisley Terrier was described in 1894 as ""an excellent house dog, and most suitable for a lady who wishes something more substantial than a toy"", but the care requirements for the coat made it less desirable than some other popular breeds as a pet.",NULL,NULL,NULL,"Y","0"

The modern Patterdale Terrier is to fell terriers, what the Jack Russell Terrier is to hunt terriers?the indisputable leader in numbers and performance as a breed. The Patterdale was developed in the harsh environment in the north of England, an area unsuitable for arable farming and too hilly (in the main) for cattle. Sheep farming is the predominant farming activity on these hills. Since the fox is perceived by farmers as being predatory on sheep and small farm animals, terriers are used for predator control. Unlike the dirt dens found in the hunt country of the south, the rocky dens found in the north do not allow much digging. As a consequence, the terrier needs to be able to bolt the fox from the rock crevice or dispatch it where it is found. The use of ""hard"" dogs to hunt foxes in this way was made illegal in England and Wales by the Hunting Act 2004, as it runs counter to the code of practice under the Act. In the United States, The Patterdale Terrier was recognised by the United Kennel Club on January 1, 1995; yet it remains unrecognized by theAmerican Kennel Club. &nbsp; <h3>Temperament</h3> Patterdale Terrier puppies tend to be bold and confident beyond their capabilities, and responsible owners of working dogs will not over match their dogs or introduce them to formidable quarry before they are around a year and a half of age. Even as a yearling, the dog will not be fully capable. The Patterdale Terrier is better known as a working terrier. Terrier work requires a high-energy dog with a strong prey drive. As a result, Patterdale Terriers are very energetic dogs. The high prey drive of this breed of dog means that they require a lot of early socialisation as puppies to prevent them becoming a quarrelsome adult. Patterdale Terriers often make fantastic pets, however, due to the aforementioned energy levels, they are often left short changed when it comes to exercise. A terrier of any breed which is left with excess energy is going to be a nightmare. They will find an outlet for it, be it by becoming aggressive, barking all the time, destroying your home, or any number of behavioural issues. However, given an appropriate amount of exercise, the Patterdale Terrier will be highly content to lie in front of your fire, and will be a quiet, and amenable member of any household. &nbsp; [button link=""http://alphamatch.com/listing-type/pets/?pet-type=1081&amp;breed-2=1035"" color=""black"" type=""big-button"" type=""Search for  Patterdale Terrier""]Search for Patterdale Terrier[/button]",NULL,NULL,NULL,"Y","0"

One exception is that modern breeders and dog-show judges seem to prefer the long-haired type over the more-traditional spaniel-type coat. They can also live up to 12?15 years. The Pekingese's flat face and large eyes are some of the breed's most obvious characteristics. The body is compact and low to the ground. Pekingese also have a muscular and durable body. The legs are noticeably bowed and restrict the Pekingese's movement. The breed's unusual rolling gait may have been deliberately developed by breeding to prevent the court dogs from wandering in ancient times. All breed standards allow all sorts of color combinations. The majority of Pekingese are gold, red or sable. Cream, black, white, sables, black and tan and occasionally 'blue' or slate grey have appeared in the breed. The latter often has poor pigment and light eyes. Albino Pekingese (white with pink eyes) should be bred cautiously due to health problems that have been associated with albinism. The Pekingese sheds a lot. A black mask or a self-colored face is equally acceptable in show dogs. Regardless of coat color, the exposed skin of the muzzle, nose, lips and eye rims is black. &nbsp; <h2>Health</h2> The Pekingese has a median lifespan of 11.4 years in a UK Kennel Club survey. The leading cause of death for Pekingese, as for many other Toy breeds, is trauma.Top leading causes of organ systems include neurologic and cardiovascular , e.g., congestiveheart failure. When diagnosed early and successfully treated with medication, a Peke with this problem can expect to live many years. A heart murmur is a potential sign of a problem, and must be evaluated by a veterinary cardiologist. Very often, the problem does not surface until the dog is 6 or more years old, so it is very difficult to screen the problem in a pup. The other main problems of the breed are eye issues and breathing problems, resulting from its tiny skull and flattened face(see Brachycephalic syndrome), and skin allergies (and hotspots). An especially common problem is eye ulcers, which may develop spontaneously. Some other eye problems that Pekingese can suffer from are Keratoconjunctivitis Sicca (Dry Eye) and Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA).<sup id=""cite_ref-3""> </sup> The Pekingese should not be kept outside, as having flattened faces and noses can cause them to develop breathing problems, making it difficult for them to regulate their body temperature in overly hot or cold weather. Their long backs, relative to their legs, make them vulnerable to back injuries. Care should be taken, when picking them up, to give adequate support to the back: one hand under the chest, the other under the abdomen. Short legs give some Pekingese difficulty with stairs; older dogs may not be able to go up or down stairs alone. In an effort to address the breathing difficulties caused by the breed's flat face, the Kennel Club (UK) significantly changed the breed standard in October 2008, removing the clause that the ""profile [should be] flat with nose well up between eyes"" and adding instead that the ""muzzle must be evident"". This was in response to public opinion following the BBC programme, Pedigree Dogs Exposed. The breed standards of two other flat-faced breeds, the Pug and English Bulldog, were soon also changed. &nbsp; [button link=""http://alphamatch.com/listing-type/pets/?pet-type=1081&amp;breed-2=1035"" color=""black"" type=""big-button"" type=""Search for  Pekingese""]Search for Pekingese[/button] &nbsp;",NULL,NULL,NULL,"Y","0"

The head is broad, massive, square, and powerful. Proper head and good expression are part of the breed standard, and are manifest in the best breed specimens. The ears are normally cropped, both to create a more formidable expression and to prevent damage while working with cattle. If cropped, the ears stand erect. In countries where ear-cropping is banned, the ears are close fitting to the head; they hang down and should be pendant or ""rose"" shaped. The upper lip is pendulous, although not excessively. Seen from the front, the upper and lower lips come together to form an inverted V. The flews are slightly divergent. The inside of the lips is a dark colour.<sup id=""cite_ref-3""> </sup> Males have a standard desirable height range of 23 to 26 inches (58 to 66 cm) at the withers, with a minimum weight at maturity of 103 pounds (47 kg) and a maximum weight of 126 pounds (57 kg). Females have a standard desirable height between 22 to 25 inches (56 to 64 cm) at the withers, with a minimum weight at maturity of 89 pounds (40 kg) and a maximum weight of 110 pounds (50 kg).<sup> </sup> The breed is also characterized by a sloping topline (with the rear being slightly higher than the shoulders). Another characteristic of the breed is the shape of the paws (cat foot) and the catlike movement of the animal. The body is mesomorphic, that is, slightly longer than the dog is tall, contributing to the feline movement. &nbsp; <h2>Coat and color</h2> The coat is short with no undercoating and slightly coarse to the touch. The coat comes in all shades of fawn and brindle. The acceptance of the black coat is a point of contention among fanciers, as it is allowed by the AKC-FSS, UKC and UPPCC standards, but not by the FCI or FCI standards. White is allowed up to 20 percent and is most commonly found on the chest and feet, and occasionally on a blaze on the muzzle. The breed standard requires black pigmentation and dogs should have a black mask that does not extend above the eyes. The breed is known for its minimal shedding. &nbsp; <h2>Temperament</h2> Presas require early socialization and obedience training. In some situations, the Presa can be aggressive toward other dogs and suspicious of strangers. They are fun and playful during the puppy stage, very loyal, loving and fun dogs. At around the 2-year-old mark they begin to fully mature and show their adult temperament and habits. Because of the sheer size and strength, it is advised to socialize early, and know what their limitations are and avoid putting them in dangerous situations. They are a pack dog and as with all pack dogs they require a strong a leader who emphasizes the individual dogs' place below the members of the family.

It is strong and powerful, with a deep and wide chest and a somewhat slimmer croup. The skin is thick and somewhat loose, but must not form folds except for a minor one on the throat. The head is powerfully built and in males, the circumference of the skull should exceed the height of the dog. They have strong jaws with a very mild underbite, and widely spaced canines. The tail is set low, thick and is carried in a slight arch when the dog is moving. Height and weight is for males 55?58 cm and 35?38 kg, for females 52?55 cm and 30?34 kg. It is a rather medium-sized dog, but can because of its mass appear larger than it really is. The colors are fawn (light brown, often in deep tones), brindle, and black (often with tan markings). White markings are permitted, but must not exceed 30% of the full coat of the dog. The size, shape and temperament varies greatly between lines.

And, of those seven breeds, we can be most certain of the Plott?s heritage and the men most responsible for its development. The ancestors of today?s Plott Hounds were used for boar hunting in Germany many years ago. Originally from Germany, Johannes ?George? Plott emigrated to the United States in 1750. He brought a few wild boar hounds with him. These dogs had been bred for generations for their stamina and gameness. George and his wife, Margaret (Undocumented Maiden Name) with their family settled in the mountains of western North Carolina. Though there is no evidence that George ever came to western North Carolina, his son Henry settled there around 1801 to 1810 (as census discloses) and was responsible for the Plott hound legend of an incredible big game dog. The Plott Balsams are a mountain range that carries the family name to this day. Plott supposedly kept his strain entirely pure, making no outcrosses. In 1780, the Plott pack passed into the hands of Henry Plott.<sup id=""cite_ref-2""> </sup> Shortly after, a hunter living in Rabun Gap, Georgia who had been breeding his own outstanding strain of ?leopard spotted dogs? heard of the fame of the Plott Hounds and came to North Carolina to see for himself. He was so impressed that he borrowed one of Montraville Plott?s top stud dogs for a year to breed to his own bitches. This single cross is the only known instance of new blood being introduced into the Plott Hound since they first came to this country. Eventually Mont decided not to continue this breeding practice and gave all the leopard dogs away, returning to his original breeding practices. Other crosses possibly took place around the year 1900. G.P. Ferguson, a neighbor of the Plott family in North Carolina in those days, was a major influence on the Plott breed. He made a careful study of the Blevins hounds and the Cable hounds of that era. To what extent he used these bloodlines in his Plott breeding program is not known. The Plott Hound was first registered with the United Kennel Club in the 1946. Plotts were recognized by the American Kennel Club in 2006. &nbsp; <h3>Appearance</h3> The Plott Hound should be athletic, muscular, and agile in appearance. It should be neither low-set and heavy, nor leggy and light: it has medium build. Its expression should be one of intelligence, confidence, and determination. Its skin should not be baggy like that of a Bloodhound. The Plott is a strongly built yet moderate hound, with a distinct brindle-colored coat. Their appearance suggests the capacity for speed, stamina and endurance. The Plott may have an identification mark on the hound used to identify the dog when out hunting. Such a mark is not penalized in conformation shows. &nbsp; [button link=""http://alphamatch.com/listing-type/pets/?pet-type=1081&amp;breed-2=1035"" color=""black"" type=""big-button"" type=""Search for  Plott Hound<span style=""line-height: 1.5em;"">""]Search for </span><span style=""line-height: 1.5em;"">Plott Hound</span><span style=""line-height: 1.5em;"">[/button]</span>",NULL,NULL,NULL,"Y","0"

According to one source, the Pointer came to be in the 16th and 17th centuries, when pointing breeds, including the Spanish pointer, were brought from the European mainland to England. Through both history and anatomical evaluation, at least four breeds appear to have been instrumental in Pointer crosses: Greyhounds, Foxhounds, Bloodhounds, and Bull Terriers. Each of these were established breeds with unique qualities the Pointer could use to do its job. Pointers were brought to the United States, where the breed flourished in the abundant open hunting land. At that time (late 1800s), the Setter was considered to be the bird-hunting dog and pointers were not even permitted to compete in field trials with setters. Around 1910, however, the Pointer began to beat the Setter at its own game. The Pointer has dominated the pointing breed field trials since then. (Fergus, 2002). One of the earliest dogs to exert influence on the breed in the US was a dog imported from England in 1876 ? ""Sensation"".He is well known as the dog on the emblem of the Westminster Kennel Club. One modern American kennel, established in 1936, and known for breeding large quantities of Pointers, Elhew Kennels produced a popular and successful line of gun dogs. Elhew pointers were well-known competitors at field trials for several decades. In the southern United States, where the dog is so dominant it is often simply referred to as the ""bird dog,"" Pointers are found in abundance. The bobwhite quail is the primary game bird there, and is considered classic English Pointer game, as the bobwhite will hold well for a pointing dog. Pointers also work game birds such as the pheasant, grouse, and woodcock with success. &nbsp; <h3>Temperament</h3> Pointers are even-tempered, congenial dogs, happiest living indoors as part of the family. Pointers are affectionate and loyal. Their aggression level is very low to nonexistent and they can happily coexist with other dogs and cats. They are typically not territorial, although their size and bark will intimidate most people who come to their door. Pointers are very good with children, although young children and a clumsy young Pointer are often not the best combination. While Pointers were bred to be hunting dogs, they are perfectly content given adequate exercise by other means. Since they are a galloping breed, regular exercise is important for them, as it is for all sporting breeds. A good-sized, securely fenced yard is a must to keep a Pointer safe, since they are bred to hunt a good distance from their person. When left for the day, they typically do best indoors. Pointers are habitual ""couch potatoes"" who enjoy relaxing on the family's chairs or sofas. This is a natural part of their desire to feel part of the pack. &nbsp; [button link=""http://alphamatch.com/listing-type/pets/?pet-type=1081&amp;breed-2=1035"" color=""black"" type=""big-button"" type=""Search for  Pointer (dog)""]Search for Pointer (dog)[/button]",NULL,NULL,NULL,"Y","0"

The coat is somewhat heavier than a Greyhound's. They have an undercoat that gets thicker in the winter. Polish Greyhounds have a longer brush on the tail and have culottes at the rear of the thighs. The average Polish Greyhound weighs about 65?95 pounds, and ranges from 27?32 inches tall. The Chart Polski has a smooth double coat, regardless of season, which is harsh to the touch while offering excellent insulation. The breed is a persistent hunter, with a long muscular neck, unlike the greyhound, and the head is carried high. Large almond eyes are set in a slant, and the points of the hip bones are wide apart. The hind legs move closer together when the dog is moving at a short trot: this is called ""lacing"". <h2>Temperament</h2> Polish Greyhounds have some similarities to other sighthounds, in that they are not overly active dogs, unless they have a purpose to be active. Such as when they are running and chasing prey. In other ways they are very unlike the typical sighthound. They can be dog aggressive, due to their being bred to hunt wolves and can be very territorial. They have a strong pack instinct and will not always accept new dogs into their home. They can be very good guard dogs in the home and they create strong bonds with their owners; in some, this instinct is so strong, they will not accept strangers coming into the home. They enjoy a good exercise regimen, walking them daily is a very good way to do this. They love to run, of course, and if they can no longer be used for actual hunting, (many locations prohibit this) then a decent facsimile would be participating in the performance sports like coursing and racing. Between running activities, they like nothing better than lounging on the couch or bed. They are obedient and easy to train, although they can be stubborn and willfull. This is not the best breed for the novice dog owner. They need early socialization and firm, fair guidance from their owners. &nbsp; [button link=""http://alphamatch.com/listing-type/pets/?pet-type=1081&amp;breed-2=1035"" color=""black"" type=""big-button"" type=""Search for  Polish Greyhound""]Search for Polish Greyhound[/button]",NULL,NULL,NULL,"Y","0"

Due to the harsh environments that these animals were subjected to, however, the population of Polish Hounds remained low. Several Polish generals bred these dogs with others to increase this population, which led to the emergence of two new breeds, Gonczy Polski (bred by Colonel Josef Pawuslewicz) and Ogar Polski (bred by Colonel Piotr Kartwik).

Poland has always been a country covered by deep forests, full of big game where the scent hound was the precious auxiliary of the hunter. Hunting with scent hounds was highly esteemed by Polish nobility as attested by 14th century chronicles. In the 17th century, at least two different types of Polish scent hounds were already well distinguished. Detailed descriptions are found in 19th century hunting literature: in 1819 Jan Szytier (Poradnik Mysliwych) describes the Polish ?brach? and the Polish scent hound; in 1821, in the magazine ?Sylwan?, W.Kozlowski gives a description and provides illustrations of both types, the Polish ?brach? (heavier) and the Polish scent hound (lighter); the very detailed description of Ignacy Bogatynski (1823?1825, Nauka Lowiectwa) could be used as the first breed standard. After the first World War, the Polish scent hound was still used for hunting in Poland; in the eastern regions but especially in the mountains on particularly difficult terrains. In the Podkarpacle region, the famous Polish cynologist, Jozef Pawuslewicz (1903?1979) hunted with Polish scent hounds; he was engaged in the development of breeding this dog. &nbsp; [button link=""http://alphamatch.com/listing-type/pets/?pet-type=1081&amp;breed-2=1035"" color=""black"" type=""big-button"" type=""Search for  Polish Hunting Dog""]Search for Polish Hunting Dog[/button] &nbsp; &nbsp;",NULL,NULL,NULL,"Y","0"

A Scottish shepherd was so impressed with the herding ability of the dogs that he traded a ram and two ewes for a dog and two female dogs. These dogs were bred with the local Scottish dogs to produce the Scottish herding dogs, most obviously theBearded Collie. Almost driven to extinction in World War II, the PON was restored mainly through the work of Dr. Danuta Hryniewicz and her dog, <i>Smok</i> (""Dragon""), the ancestor of all PONs in the world today, who sired the first ten litters of PONs in the 1950s. In fact, Dr. Hryniewicz considered Smok to be the epitome of the breed, with a perfect anatomical build and a wonderful temperament.

The breed has lived in the Polish mountains for thousands of years, but no exact date for the start of the breed was ever recorded. There is a similar mystery around what breeds were mixed to form the Polish Tatra Sheepdog. While no one is certain, many dog breeders say that the Polish Tatra Sheepdog came from the Mastiff breed. The breed was very popular among mountain workers for several centuries, and up to today. It was so popular because, as its name implies, it was a fantastic sheepdog. This success at herding sheep was mainly due to their high intelligence. When predators were around the sheep, the Polish Tatra Sheepdog would gather up the sheep and stand by them instead of trying to attack the predator, which would leave the sheep open for other attacks. This shows the immense amount of intelligence they pertained. Their white coat also made them easily distinguishable from a bear or wolves, which was very helpful for workers. Also, owners could shave the dogs and use their coat to produce wool. Mountain workers also used to hold their tails while they lead the workers through the mountains and rough terrain. Herding sheep was not the only job the breed could perform. They were often used as personal guards and frequently guarded factories and other private property. On top of this, it was often the case that the breed was used by the police force. The breed faced some hard times, though. After the World Wars the breed was on the brink of extinction.

These dogs are commonly known as the Wolfspitz or Spitz type, which is German for ""sharp point"" which was the term originally used by Count Eberhard zu Sayn in the 16th Century as a reference to the features of the dog's nose and muzzle. The Pomeranian is considered to be descended from the German Spitz.<sup id=""cite_ref-vanderlip_24-0""> </sup> The breed is thought to have acquired its name by association with the area known as Pomerania which is located in northern Poland and Germany along the Baltic Sea. Although not the origin of the breed, this area is credited with the breeding which led to the original Pomeranian type of dog. Proper documentation was lacking until the breed's introduction into the United Kingdom. An early modern recorded reference to the Pomeranian breed is from 2 November 1764, in a diary entry in James Boswell's <i>Boswell on the Grand Tour: Germany and Switzerland</i>. ""The Frenchman had a Pomeranian dog named Pomer whom he was mighty fond of."" The offspring of a Pomeranian and a wolf bred by an animal merchant from London is discussed in Thomas Pennant's <i>A Tour in Scotland</i> from 1769. Two members of the British Royal Family influenced the evolution of the breed. In 1767, Queen Charlotte, Queen-consort of King George III of England, brought two Pomeranians to England. Named Phoebe and Mercury, the dogs were depicted in paintings by Sir Thomas Gainsborough. These paintings depicted a dog larger than the modern breed, reportedly weighing as much as 30?50 lb (14?23 kg), but showing modern traits such as the heavy coat, ears and a tail curled over the back. Queen Victoria, Queen Charlotte's granddaughter, was also an enthusiast and established a large breeding kennel. One of her favoured dogs was a comparatively small red sable Pomeranian which she named ""Windor's Marco"" and was reported to weigh only 12 lb (5.4 kg). When she first exhibited Marco in 1891, it caused the smaller type Pomeranian to become immediately popular and breeders began selecting only the smaller specimens for breeding. During her lifetime, the size of the Pomeranian breed was reported to have decreased by 50%. Queen Victoria worked to improve and promote the Pomeranian breed by importing smaller Pomeranians of different colors from various European countries to add to her breeding program.

Their descendants, the Moors, arrived in Portugal in the 8th century, bringing the water dogs with them. Another theory proposes that some of the dogs left the Asian steppes with the Goths, a confederation of German tribes. Some, (the Ostrogoths), went west and their dogs became the German poodle, called in German the poodle-hund or puddle-dog, that is, water-dog. Others, (the Visigoths), went south to fight the Romans, and their dogs became the Lion Dog, groomed in the traditional lion cut. In 413 CE, the Visigoths invadedIberia (modern Spain and Portugal, then known as Hispania) and the dogs found their homeland before being settled in Aquitania north of the Pyrenees in 418 before extending their rule to most of Iberia after 470 A.D. A Portuguese Water Dog is first described in 1297 in a monk?s account of a drowning sailor who was pulled from the sea by a dog with a ""black coat, the hair long and rough, cut to the first rib and with a tail tuft"".<sup id=""cite_ref-HPWD_11-0""> </sup> ""History of the Portuguese Water Dog"", Kathryn Braund and Deyanne Farrell Miller, <i>The Complete Portuguese Water Dog</i>, 1986, webpage: DeLeao. These theories explain how the Poodle and the Portuguese Water Dog may have developed from the same ancient genetic pool. At one time the Poodle was a longer-coated dog, as is one variety of the Portuguese Water Dog. The possibility also exists that some of the long-coated water dogs grew up with the ancient Iberians. In early times, Celtiberians migrated from lands which now belong to southwestern Germany. Swarming over the Pyrenees, circulating over the whole of western Europe, they established bases in Iberia, as well as in Ireland, Wales, and Brittany. The Irish Water Spaniel and Kerry Blue Terrier are believed by some to be descendants of the Portuguese Water Dog. &nbsp; <h3>Temperament</h3> Portuguese Water dogs make excellent companions. They are loving, independent, and intelligent and are easily trained in obedience and agility skills. Once introduced, they are generally friendly to strangers, and enjoy being petted, which, due to their soft, fluffy coats, is a favour that human beings willingly grant them. Because they are working dogs, PWDs are generally content in being at their master's side, awaiting directions, and, if they are trained, they are willing and able to follow complex commands. They learn very quickly, seem to enjoy the training, and have a long memory for the names of objects. These traits and their non-shedding coats mean they excel at the various Service Dog roles such as hearing dogs (assistance dogs for the deaf), mobility dogs, and seizure response dogs. They also make unusually good therapy dogs. &nbsp; <h2>Description</h2> The closest relatives of the PWD are widely thought to be the Kerry Blue Terrier, Barbet and Standard Poodle. Like Poodles and several other water dog breeds, PWDs are highly intelligent, can have curly coats, have webbed toes for swimming, and do not shed. However, Portuguese Water Dogs are more robustly built, with stout legs, and can have a wavy coat instead of tightly curled. If comparing the structure to that of a Poodle, there are significant differences between the two breeds. The Portuguese Water Dog is built of strong substantial bone; well developed, neither refined nor coarse, and a solidly built, muscular body. The Portuguese Water Dog is off-square, slightly longer than tall when measured from prosternum to rearmost point of the buttocks, and from withers to ground. Portuguese Water Dog eyes are black or various tones of brown, and their coats can be black, brown, black and white or brown and white. Male Portuguese Water Dogs usually grow to be about 20 to 23 inches (51 cm to 58 cm) tall, and they weigh between 40 and 60 pounds (18 kg to 27 kg), while the females usually grow to be about 17 to 21 inches (43 cm to 53 cm) tall, and they weigh between 35 and 50 pounds (15 kg to 22 kg) &nbsp; [button link=""http://alphamatch.com/listing-type/pets/?pet-type=1081&amp;breed-2=1035"" color=""black"" type=""big-button"" type=""Search for Portuguese Water Dog""]Search for Portuguese Water Dog[/button]",NULL,NULL,NULL,"Y","0"

From seven specific Poodlesand nearly 100 different pointers, he developed the Pudelpointer. The original sire was Tell, an English Pointer belonging to Kaiser Frederick III and the original dam was a German hunting pudel named Molly who was owned by Hegewald, an author known for works on hunting dogs. The goal was to produce a dog that was willing and easy to train, intelligent, and loved water and retrieving, like the poodle, and add to that a great desire to hunt, a strong pointing instinct, and an excellent nose, like in the English Pointer, as well as being an excellent companion in the home. The Poodle breed had much stronger genes, and so many more Pointers were used to achieve the balanced hunting dog that was desired. A mix of 11 Pudels and 80 Pointers were used during the first 30 years to achieve the desired traits and results. The breed was introduced to North America in 1956 by Bodo Winterhelt, who to this day, remains very involved in maintaining the breed standard. His Winterhelle Kennel was the foundation of the breed in North America. In 1977 Winterhelt founded the Pudelpointer Club of North America in Canada. In Germany as well as North America, its performance standards are its most important trait. Before being approved for breeding, dogs and bitches must pass Hunt Test with minimum scores of their performance tests of its field, tracking and water skills. set by the various breed clubs. These clubs are the Verein Pudelpointer in Germany and the following clubs in North America; NAPPA, PCNA and VPP-GNA) The pudelpointer has never become a popularized breed in the United States in part because breeders have actively avoided recognition by the American Kennel Club. Breeders believe that AKC recognition would place too much emphasis on form over function, possibly splitting the breed into a show breed and separate working class. &nbsp; [button link=""http://alphamatch.com/listing-type/pets/?pet-type=1081&amp;breed-2=1035"" color=""black"" type=""big-button"" type=""Search for   Pudelpointer""]Search for Pudelpointer[/button]",NULL,NULL,NULL,"Y","0"

The Puli were used for both herding and guarding livestock. The Puli would commonly work together with the much larger, white Komondor, a Hungarian dog breed of (solely) livestock guardian dog. The Komondor is a large, solidly-built dog, around 30 inches tall. The Komondor (or several Komondors if there was a large amount livestock) guarded the sheep or cattle mostly at night, while the Puli herded and guarded them during the day. When wolves or bears attacked the livestock, the Puli would alert the pack and the Komondors would come and fight the intruders. Puli can be good at fighting off wolves, because the thick coat protects their skin from being bitten. The Komondors usually rested during daytime but at night walked around the flock, constantly moving, patrolling the area. Nomadic shepherds of the Hungarian plains valued their herding dogs, paying as much as a year's salary for a Puli. In Asia, the breed dates back 2,000 years and anecdotal evidence suggests that a Puli-like dog existed 6,000 years ago. This breed is possibly the ancestor of the modernPoodle. Although the coats may look slightly similar, the Puli has never worked in water and the Puli's coat does not grow continuously in the same fashion as a Poodle's once the cords are formed. The ancestry of the Puli, however, is not known with certainty as there are some references to Ancient Rome.<sup><i> </i></sup> Possibly the Puli?s ancestors are ancient Hungarian shepherd dogs. Travelers brought the Puli with them to the Carpathian-basin, to help organize the flocks, and herd the stallions of the area. The huge Komondor and the Kuvasz were used for guarding the belongings of the owner. while the Puli would keep the animals together. Around the beginning of the 20th Century a real turning point for the breed came when it was rediscovered but no longer used much as a sheep dog; extensive shepherding was replaced by intensive farming. The Puli?s role was reduced in the life of the flock. Although, their traditional duty was kept, they started to fulfill jobs that were convenient in the circumstances of their owner: they became house dogs. After World War II, the breed became a less popular pet; even now the breed has not been able to regain the popularity it previously enjoyed. &nbsp; <h3>Appearance</h3> The Puli is a solid colored dog that is usually black.

It originated in the 17th or 18th century, when shepherding terriers were brought to Hungary from Germany and France. These terrier-type dogs mixed with the Puli-type dogs that were in Hungary, and the result was a terrier-type herding dog. As a working dog, it was quite freely bred until the 1970s, and other Hungarian dogs such as the Puli and Mudi were used for breeding. Until recently there has been a special B-registry for work bred Pumi. The parentage of these dogs are unknown, but if they meet the breed standard, they can be given a ""B-pedigree"". The Pumi received FCI recognition in 1966. The breed was quite unknown outside Hungary until the 1970s. In 1973, the first Pumis were exported to Finland, and in 1985 to Sweden. Later, Pumis were exported also to Germany, Netherlands, Italy, and in the 1990s to the USA. &nbsp; <h3>Appearance</h3> Most Pumis are gray, and any shade of gray is accepted in the show ring.

It is known that they originated in the mountainous north of Korea in Pungsan county (now known as Kimhy?nggw?n. Their thick coat is a protection against the freezing temperatures of northern Korea, and they were bred to be resistant to the cold. In old Korean tales, the dogs were famous for their cleverness and loyalty, as well as their hunting ability; there is even a famous story of a Pungsan defeating a Siberian tiger. &nbsp; <h2>Appearance</h2> The Pungsan is a mixed breed with wolf found in North Korea. Pungsan have a thick coat, usually white in color. They have a curled tail and pricked ears. The Pungsan's fur is very fine and thick to account for the cold winters in the northern Korean peninsula. Pungsan are a common breed in North Korea. Though this breed is extremely rare outside of North Korea, there are a few breeders in South Korea and even in the United States. Pungsan dogs are very strong and agile because of their past in mountainous regions. They have traditionally been used for hunting large animals, including Amur Tigers. They have a lot of stamina and therefore require extensive exercise. Due to their hunting personality, Pungsan pups will have a tendency to chew on several things so it is recommendable to give the dog things to chew. Pungsan tend to be loyal to their owners and whoever they are comfortable with. Everyone else will be ignored, unless they invade in what is to be perceived as their space or territory. They'll only bark at other people when it is necessary to do so. However, due to the breed still being closely linked to the wolf, aggression and a high prey drive are typical and to be expected. &nbsp; [button link=""http://alphamatch.com/listing-type/pets/?pet-type=1081&amp;breed-2=1035"" color=""black"" type=""big-button"" type=""Search for   Pungsan Dog""]Search for Pungsan Dog[/button] &nbsp;",NULL,NULL,NULL,"Y","0"

The smooth-faced Pyrenean Shepherd in its harlequin or blue merle coloration may have been one of the foundation breeds for the Australian Shepherd when sheep herders brought their sheepdogs to the American West when they flew to the United States as contract herders for the Western Range Association in the 1940s until the early 1970s.<sup id=""cite_ref-3""> </sup> It is not yet a well-known breed outside of its native France, but its size, intelligence, and attractive coat make it appealing. After one of its breed won the World Agility Championship for midsized dogs in 2003, it gained more attention as an intelligent performance dog for dog sports. &nbsp; <h3>Temperament</h3> <div>The Pyrenean Shepherd was designed to be a sheepdog, and as such is full of the same sort of energy that other herding dogs have, but in a surprisingly small package. This adaptive dog wants to, and can, do all the jobs on the field, and is a natural herder. A dog that needs a job, its cleverness makes it ideal for other work and dog sports such as flyball, competitive obedience and agility. This dog is good with children that they were brought up with. They have a sense of protector over the children.</div> Pyr Sheps are ""one-man"" dogs, attached and dedicated to their owners, with a desire to follow them around the house to help with daily chores. They sense every mood and often seem to be able to read their masters' minds, as they are constantly watchful. Because of this, they are extremely trainable. Their natural wariness, while valuable in a herding dog that may need to alert their shepherd of strange animals or people, combined with their herding bossiness, can lead to shyness or aggression in even the most friendly puppy if not properly managed. Frequent socialization from a very young age can help counter this trait. &nbsp; <h3>Appearance</h3> <div>The Pyrenean Shepherd is the smallest of the French herding dogs. The breed comes in two varieties: Rough-faced and smooth-Faced. Rough-faced males are 15 <sup>1</sup>?<sub>2</sub> to 18 <sup>1</sup>?<sub>2</sub> inches (39 to 47 cm) at the withers, and rough-faced females are 15 to 18 inches (38 to 46 cm).

The weight is between 15?32 pounds (7?15 kg), aiming for lithe and muscular, never fat.</div> The head is of small proportions in comparison to the dog, with a rather flat skull, and a somewhat short, triangular muzzle. The face is expressive and intelligent, with dark eyes, except in the case of merles or slate grey coat colour. Traditionally the dog's ears are cropped. If natural, the Pyrenean Shepherd should have semi-prick or rose ears. Naturally prick ears are not correct for the breed, and may indicate an outcross.<sup> </sup> The body is long and lean, and should reflect the natural energetic athleticism of the dog. The legs are well proportioned, with lean, well-angulated, well-let-down hocks typical of a sure-footed mountain breed.

Perhaps in the future, DNA evidence will prove when the dogs arrived and what their ancestry is, but for now there is no proof, only legends, guesswork, and speculation.

It is also believed that once 4 Rajapalayams saved the life of their master fighting against a tiger and killing it bravely many years before near forest in Virudhunagar district of Tamil Nadu. They are largely used to guard the rice fields,houses and farms. Since last two decades Indian Army started using them as guard dogs to support the army in the borders of Kashmir. &nbsp; <h2>Appearance</h2> It is a large dog, usually measuring about 65?75 cm (25?30 inches) at the withers. It is a hound, and therefore should be kept in optimum working condition. It tends to be heavier boned than most sighthounds, but shares the depth of chest and basic body structure. Its facial structure is considerably different from that of a Caravan Hound, as it is meant primarily for hunting wild boar. The tail has a slight curl. The most prized colour is milk white, with a pink nose and golden eyes. However, other colours including spotted or solid, black, and brown, are known to occur. The spots will start showing up by 80 days from birth. In the past, puppies of colour were usually culled from the litters since the owners preferred the pure white dogs. The coat is short and fine. An extremely handsome and graceful dog, the Rajapalayam has a gait similar to the trotting of a thoroughbred horse. As with many fully white dogs, there is a high incidence of deafness in this breed. Puppies born with whitish or blue eyes are deaf. Many Rajapalayam dogs suffer from mange, though this is usually not a serious problem. Though the breed dates back a few centuries, the creators of the breed unwittingly ended up fashioning an albino dog, characterized by the pink nose and the lack of pigmentation. <h2>Temperament</h2> The Rajapalayam was used predominantly for hunting wild boar and as a formidable guard dog. It needs wide open spaces and is very affectionate and devoted towards its owner, although not always demonstrative.They do not usually like to be touched or handled by strangers and are known to be one-man dogs. Most specimens are aggressive and hostile towards strangers, and will attack intruders. Socialization in puppyhood is important. Rajapalayams usually do not get along well with other pets like cats, owing to their strong hunting instincts. &nbsp; [button link=""http://alphamatch.com/listing-type/pets/?pet-type=1081&amp;breed-2=1035"" color=""black"" type=""big-button"" type=""Search for Rajapalayam (dog)""]Search for Rajapalayam (dog)[/button]",NULL,NULL,NULL,"Y","0"

He gave the name 'Rampur Hound' to the dogs he bred. The Rampur Hound far exceeded the his expectations. From its Tazi and Afghan ancestors it got its looks and stalwart character, and from the English Greyhound it got its speed. Here was a dog that would seldom back down in confrontations, and could more or less keep up with the fastest prey. With the fall of the Maharajahs from power in 1947, so too, fell the popularity of the Rampur Hound. The effect of the arrival of the English was evident to the Rampur, as well as the native Indian people. The English greyhound was bred into some of the lines, making it very difficult to find a purebred Rampur Greyhound. With the decline in hunting in India the dog's popularity plummeted. It was no longer fashionable or practical for the rich to keep them, while the poorer population simply could not afford to keep them. In recent years, however, its popularity has risen, and along with this, the breed's numbers. This remarkable breed balances on the fine line of extinction. Outside of India, only a handful are known and registered, and are all located in the United States of America, in state of New Jersey. &nbsp; <h3>Temperament</h3> The breed loves human companionship, and is well adjusted to other dogs. It has clean habits. They may appear lazy but will charge if needed. The Rampur in play is a scary thing to the uninitiated. They like to charge at each other at speed, then butt their chests with extensive force. They are affectionate to their owners, almost to a fault. Even so, the Rampur Hound is still a commanding breed and makes an excellent guard-dog. It is fiercely protective of its family, although it tends to be a one-person dog and will usually obey only one master. Within family circles, especially with children, it is dependably gentle and sensitive. It is advisable, of course, to supervise interactions and see that the children don't take undue advantage of this innate good nature. It is also a large dog, and with a surfeit of affection, is capable of, however unintentionally, knocking over both children and adults. The distinct penchant of the Rampur Hound of starting?and, more often than not, ending?fights with other dogs is another factor that needs watching. This apart, before obtaining a Rampur Hound its size and exercise requirements should be taken into consideration. It needs plenty of space and probably will be not be happy to be confined in a small apartment. It is also a robust breed and not susceptible to many of the physiological problems that its Western counterparts are often prone to. &nbsp; <h3>Appearance</h3> The length from the withers to the base of the tail is about 36 inches, the chest is deep in front but not very wide with well sprung ribs. The tail is long and tapering slightly curving upwards and carried low; it is about 24""?27"" in length. The circumference of the neck is about 12 inches and its long arched and muscular and rather broad where it joins the body. The length of the jaw is 9 inches and are powerful with a scissor bite. The males measure 60?75 cm (24?30 in) in height. The females measure 55?60 cm (22?24 in) in height. They weigh about 27?30 kg (60?65 lb). They are approximately greyhound size, but much wider and more muscular, similar to the Rhodesian Ridgeback.The head of the Rampur is broader and more substantial than the head of the English Greyhound. It has a flat skull and a pointed nose. It also has a characteristic roman bend. Some other unique characteristics are their Roman nose, ears set high, pendant style, and of most interest, their ""hare"" feet. The Rampur's foot is a large ""hare"" shape, with heavy webbing. Their toes are very articulated and flexible, even able to bend backwards a bit. They are not unlike our own fingers in many ways. This maneuverability helps to give them a cat-like balance, able to walk on ledges, or to calmly clear a six foot fence. Colors are mouse-gray, grizzle, brindle, parti-colour or most rare, black. Black however is the most sought after. Eye color ranges from yellow to a golden brown. A word about the gray and grizzle color. These two colors have the ability to blend completely with the foliage of the forest, so much so that when the hound is still, you may not see them from a distance of as little as ten feet, in broad daylight. Its bite is extremely powerful. &nbsp; [button link=""http://alphamatch.com/listing-type/pets/?pet-type=1081&amp;breed-2=1035"" color=""black"" type=""big-button"" type=""Search for Rampur Greyhound""]Search for Rampur Greyhound[/button]",NULL,NULL,NULL,"Y","0"

Hatch is thought to have been a mongrel, and was brought on board to control the rat population.<sup id=""cite_ref-4""> </sup> The breed name comes from the occupation of its earliest ancestors brought to the US by working-class British migrants as the dogs were used in rat pit gambling. However they were, for the most part, bred for speed. Their speed is used for controlling vermin and hunting small game such as squirrels and hares. After the 1890s, as the breed type became popular in America, Beagle, Italian Greyhounds and Miniature Pinschers were bred in. Many of the foundation Rat Terriers were indistinguishable from small mixed-breed hunting dogs known as ""feists"". The smaller varieties diverged from the Rat Terrier line very early on, with UKC registration for the Toy Fox Terrier beginning in 1936. Rat Terriers were cherished as loyal hunting companions and efficient killers of vermin on 20th century American farms: as a result, they were one of the most popular dog types from the 1920s to the 1940s. However the widespread use of chemical pesticides and the growth of commercial farming led to a sharp decline in the breed from the 1950s onwards. Fortunately breed loyalists maintained the bloodline, leading to the modern Rat Terrier. The genetic diversity of the Rat Terrier has contributed to the overall health, keen intelligence, and soundness of the breed. Most modern breeds were developed from a few founding dogs and then propagated from a closed gene pool. In contrast, the Rat Terrier has benefited from a long history of refinement with regular outcrosses to bring in useful qualities and genetic variability. &nbsp; <h3>Appearance</h3> The Rat Terrier comes in a variety of coat colors and sizes. The classic coloring is black tanpoint with piebald spotting (known as black tricolor), but chocolate, tan (varying in shade from pale gold to dark mahogany), blue, isabella (pearl), lemon and apricot are all fairly common. They may be tricolor or bicolor, always with some amount of white present. Sable may overlay any of these colors. Creeping tan (often ""Calico""), is also acceptable. Ticking is usually visible in the white parts of the coat, or in the underlying skin. Brindle, currently disallowed by the main breed standards, is considered by some to be a traditional Rat Terrier pattern, and there is a growing movement to have this pattern accepted into the breed. However, merle is widely considered to be the result of recent outcrosses and, because of associated health problems, is rejected by most Rat Terrier breeders. &nbsp; <h3>Temperament</h3> Although often mistaken for a Jack Russell Terrier, the Rat Terrier has a different profile and a very different temperament. Rat Terriers are sleeker in musculature, finer of bone, and have a more refined head. They always have a short single coat, rather than being wire coated. Rat Terriers tend to be less aggressive than Jack Russells; while they have a definite terrier personality they also have an ""off switch"" and love lounging on the sofa in a lap as much as tearing about the yard. Rat Terriers are normally cheerful dogs, and they tend to be calmer and more sensitive than Jack Russells to changes in their environment, owner's moods, or to unexpected noises, people, and activities. The social sensitivity of Rat Terriers makes them very trainable and easier to live with for the average pet owner, but it also means that extensive socialization from an early age is critical. Proper socialization of a Rat Terrier puppy includes exposing the animal to a wide variety of people and places, particularly during the first three months of life. Like most active and intelligent breeds, Rat Terriers tend to be happier when they receive a great deal of mental stimulation and exercise. &nbsp; [button link=""http://alphamatch.com/listing-type/pets/?pet-type=1081&amp;breed-2=1035"" color=""black"" type=""big-button"" type=""Search for  Rat Terrier""]Search for Rat Terrier[/button]",NULL,NULL,NULL,"Y","0"

Most often, these dogs were imported so that wealthy planters of the Tidewater could mimic the European gentry and engage in foxhunting, with smaller amounts of dogs winding up on small farms. However, after the American Revolution, as settlement pushed farther West and deeper South, hunters discovered they had a problem: the hounds imported from the late 18th and early 19th century British Isles and France were bred to hunt in different terrain than what was on offer in the American South. By late in the reign of George III much of the original oak forests of England, Scotland, and Ireland had long since been cut down to service the Royal Navy and many of the peat bogs were being mined for use as a source of fuel; with the exceptions of badgers, rabbits, and foxes much of the original fauna that would have inhabited these lands had become extirpated over time. The French aristocracy owned a few private reserves for themselves to hunt in, but typically their dogs could get away with having a colder nose as the amount of land to hunt on was still limited. This was in stark contrast to the American South, which included many hundreds of miles of subtropical bald cypress swamps and hardwood forest . The terrain was loaded with animals that would fight back viciously to the death, like alligators, black bears, porcupines, cougars, or raccoons. When confronted with such conditions the European breeds were almost useless since none of the aforementioned animals burrow into the ground or passively run from trouble: when confronted with prey that climbed a tree or in some cases tried to throw off their pursuers in deep, swampy water, the dogs would mill about pacing below the tree, confused. When confronted with porcupines, they would sometimes even flee when the lead dog was quilled. Over time, Southern hunters would selectively breed dogs that would not back down, had great stamina, and would ""hound"" their prey until they treed or cornered their exhausted quarry, leading to modern coonhounds. In the late 18th century Scottish immigrants brought with them red colored foxhounds to Georgia, dogs which would be the foundation stock of the Redbone. Later, c. 1840 Irish bred Foxhounds and Bloodhound lines were added to the mix. The name would come from an early breeder, Peter Redbone of Tennessee, though other breeders of note are Mr. Redbone's contemporary, Georgia F.L. Birdsong of Georgia, and the Dr. Thomas Henry in the 19th century. Over time, breeders followed a selective program that led to a coonhound that is more specialized for prey which climbs trees relative to European hunting dogs, was unafraid of taking on large animals, was agile enough to carry on over mountain or in meadow, and liked to swim if necessary. They were ideal for pack hunting of both small and larger prey. Originally, the Redbone had a black saddleback, but by the beginning of the 20th century, they were an uninterrupted red tone. &nbsp; <h3>Temperament</h3> The Redbone Coonhound is an excellent companion and family pet, with some special considerations. They love to be with their owners and family, and are happy just doing things with their humans, or sitting nearby, watching them: a Redbone Coonhound who has been left out of the family fun or penned up during the party is often a heartbroken one. Overall, they are very affectionate and loving: they will often leap to their feet barking loudly to greet their master upon his return home and a typical Redbone will shower everyone with love, licking the faces of family, friends, and possibly other dogs. However, a dog of this breed typically will not seek attention as fervently as other breeds (such as aLabrador Retriever). They are very happy if you pet them, and love it. They are also a very boisterous breed: as explained above, adult Redbones grow to a large size. They may not know how big and strong they are when young and thus may accidentally knock over elderly adults and young children if left untrained or never taught the command ""heel,"" so basic obedience should be emphasized with this breed. The Redbone is an extremely vocal dog, as would be expected of a hound. The breed is known for its distinctive ""drawling"" bark, also known as a ""bay."" Hunters who use the breed follow the sound of the loud howls as the dogs track quarry. It takes training to first control their excited, emotional, booming barks, but also to help provide the hounds an outlet for their 'tracking' desires that sometimes drive their vocalizations. &nbsp; <h3>Appearance</h3> The Redbone Coonhound has a lean, muscular, well proportioned build. The body type is typical to the coonhounds subgroup, with long straight legs, a wide barrel chest, and a head and tail that is held high and proud when hunting or showing. The Redbone's face is often described as having a pleading expression, with sorrowful dark brown or hazel eyes and long, drooping ears. Their coat is short and smooth against the body, but coarse enough to provide protection to the skin while hunting through dense underbrush. Their paws have especially thick pads and are also webbed and dewclaws are common. The nose should be black and prominent. The ears are floppy and should extend to nearly the end of the nose if stretched out. Coloration of the nose is always black and the coat color is always a rich red, though a small amount of white on the chest, between the legs, or on the feet is permissible, though not preferred. Variations of black fur on the face and muzzle are also not uncommon. The toes are typically webbed. &nbsp; [button link=""http://alphamatch.com/listing-type/pets/?pet-type=1081&amp;breed-2=1035"" color=""black"" type=""big-button"" type=""Search for  Redbone Coonhound""]Search for Redbone Coonhound[/button]",NULL,NULL,NULL,"Y","0"

This dog measured approximately 18 inches (46 cm) at the withers, with a lean but muscular frame. The ears have been described both as erect and hanging, but the most distinctive feature was the length of hair growing in the reverse direction along its back. Within 53 years of the Dutch settlement, the Europeans were using these local dogs themselves.<sup id=""cite_ref-fox6_1-0""> </sup> By the 1860s, European settlers had brought a variety of dog breeds to this area of Africa, including Great Danes, Bloodhounds, Greyhounds,and terriers. These breeds were bred with the indigenous African dogs, including the dog of the Khoikhoi people, which resulted in the Boer hunting dogs, a forerunner to the modern Rhodesian Ridgeback.<sup id=""cite_ref-fox6_1-1""> </sup> Reverend Charles Helm travelled to the Hope Fountain Mission in Southern Rhodesia in the 1870s, taking two ridged dogs with him. It was there that Cornelius van Rooyen, a big?game hunter, saw them and decided to breed his own dogs with them to incorporate their guarding abilities. The offspring were dogs with red coats and ridges,. They became the foundation stock of a kennel which developed dogs over the next thirty five years with the ability to bay lions, that is, to hold them at bay while the hunter makes the kill. The dogs were used to hunt not only lions but also other game, including wild pigs and baboons. (They have the ability to kill a baboon independent of a human hunter.) The first breed standard was written by Mr F.R. Barnes inBulawayo, Rhodesia in 1922. Based on that of the Dalmatian, it was approved in 1926 by the South African Kennel Union.<sup id=""cite_ref-aussieridgeback_5-0""> </sup> The first Rhodesian Ridgebacks in Britain were shown by Mrs. Edward Foljambe in 1928. In 1950, Mr. and Mrs. William H. O'Brien of Arizona brought six carefully selected Ridgebacks to the US from South Africa.He and his wife and Mrs. Margaret Lowthian of California began the process of getting the breed accepted by the American Kennel Club. The breed was admitted into the American Kennel Club in 1955 as a member of the Hound Group. <h3>Appearance</h3> The Rhodesian Ridgeback's distinguishing feature is the ridge of hair running along its back in the opposite direction from the rest of its coat. It consists of a fan-like area formed by two whorls of hair (called ""crowns"") and tapers from immediately behind the shoulders down to the level of the hips. The ridge is usually about 2 inches (5 cm) in width at its widest point. It is believed to originate from the dog used by the original African dog population which had a similar ridge. The first depiction of a Ridgeback is a wall painting describing the life of the Boers, housed in South Africa in the Voortrekker Monument. Male Ridgebacks should stand 63 cms (25 ins) to 69cms (27 ins) at the withers and weigh about 85 lb (39 kg) FCI Standard); females should be 24?26 inches (61?66 cm) tall and about 70 lb (32 kg) in weight. Ridgebacks are typically muscular and have a light wheaten to red wheaten coat, which should be short, dense, sleek and glossy in appearance, and neither woolly nor silky. White is acceptable on the chest and toes. The presence of black guard hairs or ticking is not addressed in the AKC standard, although the elaboration of the AKC standard notes the amount of black or dark brown in the coat should not be excessive. The FCI Standard states that excessive black hairs throughout the coat are highly undesirable. Ridgebacks sometimes have a dark mask. The dog's nose should be black or brown (liver) in keeping with the color of the dog. No other colored nose is permissible. The brown nose is a recessive gene. It is not as common as a black nose; some breeders believe the inclusion of brown noses in a breeding program is necessary for maintaining the vibrancy of the coat. The eyes should be round and should reflect the dog's color: dark eyes with a black nose, amber eyes with a brown (liver) nose. Ridgebacks have a strong, smooth tail, which is usually carried in a gentle curve backwards. The original standard allowed for a variety of coat colors, including brindle and sable. The modern FCI standard calls for light wheaten to red wheaten. &nbsp; [button link=""http://alphamatch.com/listing-type/pets/?pet-type=1081&amp;breed-2=1035"" color=""black"" type=""big-button"" type=""Search for  Rhodesian Ridgeback""]Search for Rhodesian Ridgeback[/button]",NULL,NULL,NULL,"Y","0"

A multi-faceted herding and stock protection dog, it is capable of working all kinds of livestock under a variety of conditions.<sup id=""cite_ref-3""> </sup> The breed's history likely dates to the Roman Empire. It is likely that the Rottweiler is a descendant of ancient Roman drover dogs, a mastiff-type dog that was a dependable, rugged dog with great intelligence and guarding instincts. During their quest to conquer Europe, the Roman legion traveled in large numbers across the continent. The non-existence of refrigeration meant the soldiers had to bring herds of cattle with them on their excursions for food. These drover dogs were not only used to keep the herds of cattle together, but to guard the supply stock at night. Around 74 A.D. the Roman army travelled across the alps and into the southern part of modern day Germany. For the next two centuries the Roman drover dogs were continually utilized in herding and driving cattle for trade even after the Romans were driven out of the area by the Swabians.<sup id=""cite_ref-akchistory_5-0""> </sup> A town in this region was eventually given the name Rottweil. It became an important trade center and the descendants of the Roman cattle dogs proved their worth by driving the cattle to market and protecting the cattle from robbers and wild animals. The dogs are said to have been used by traveling butchers at markets during the Middle Ages to guard money pouches tied around their necks. The dogs eventually came to be called Rottweiler Metzgerhunds, or butcher dogs. As railroads became the primary method for moving stock to market, the need for the breed declined, as did the number of Rottweilers. The number of Rottweilers diminished so severely that by 1882 in a dog show in Heilbronn, there was only one very poor representative of the breed.<sup id=""cite_ref-akchistory_5-4""> </sup> The buildup to World War I saw a great demand for police dogs, and that led to a revival of interest in the Rottweiler. During the First and Second World Wars, Rottweilers were put into service in various roles, including as messenger, ambulance, draught, and guard dogs.

It originated mostly from English Cocker Spaniels and English Springer Spaniels. Breeds known as Russian Spaniels have been mentioned as early as 1891 in New Zealand.</div> The first recorded spaniel in Russia was a black Cocker Spaniel owned by hunting enthusiast Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich towards the end of the 19th century. Because of its noble connections, spaniels of various breeds were imported to St. Petersburg and Moscow. Some were used for hunting, but the smaller spaniels were not of much use in Russian bird hunting due to the weather and terrain conditions. It was at the beginning of the 20th century that selective breeding began for longer legged spaniels; specifically importing Springer Spaniels to create a rather mixed Russian Spaniel.<sup id=""cite_ref-rschistory_9-2""> </sup> By the late 1930s there were a variety of spaniels in Moscow, Leningrad and Sverdlovsk that did not fit any specific spaniel breed standard, but were not yet standardised into the modern Russian Spaniel. Purposeful breeding after World War II led to the original Russian Spaniel standard in 1951. Further revised standards were issued in 1966 and 2000.<sup id=""cite_ref-standard_13-1""> </sup> The popularity of the breed in Russia increased after the early 1990s, with Moscow dog shows since that time annually including between 120 and 131 Russian Spaniels, which qualifies the breed as one of the most popular, along with the Irish Setter. In 2002, the Russian Spaniel Club was set up in the United States to increase the knowledge of the breed outside Russia and to enable owners to register their dogs.<sup id=""cite_ref-rschistory_9-3""> </sup> <h2>Health</h2> As with all long-eared spaniels, Russian Spaniels require checks to prevent ear infections. The breed does have an inclination to gain weight easily, which can be prevented by controlling food intake. The Russian Spaniel can be prone to food allergies, which are usually identified at between 1 to 5 months of age with the most common allergens being chicken and carrots. There are no other breed-specific health issues currently known.<sup id=""cite_ref-rscabout_8-2""> </sup> <h2>Temperament</h2> It is an energetic, free-spirited breed.

The first standard for the two varieties was written in 1966 and authorized by the Ministry of Agriculture. After the fall of the Iron Curtain, a number of foreign small breed dogs were imported, and this caused the popularity of the Russkiy Toy to decline. By the 1990s, the long haired type of Russkiy Toy had hit critical numbers, but luckily a resurgence occurred due to a new generation of dog breeders. Until this time the breed was virtually unknown outside of its homeland.<sup id=""cite_ref-akcdidyou_8-3""> </sup> The Russian / Russkiy Toy was recognised by the Federation Cynologique Internationale in 2006 With the United Kennel Club in 2008. Russian Toys are also recognized by the American Rare Breed Association, North American Kennel Club and International All Breed Canine Association. &nbsp; <h2>Health</h2> A Russkiy Toy will often require veterinarian assistance in changing from its puppy teeth to its adult set. Without this surgery, two rows of teeth will form which can cause gum infections, bad breath and prevent the permanent adult set from coming forward.<sup id=""cite_ref-pomdies_4-0""> </sup> As with most breeds of dog, the Russkiy Toy can suffer from patellar luxation, which is where the knee cap slips out of place when the knee bends as the groove that normally holds it in place is too shallow.

The name Saluqi has many theories. Linguistics agree the word Saluqi in Arabic is an adjective referring to where an individual was from. Sir Terence Clark reports on four possible locations for the place Saluq including today's Yemen, Iraq and Turkey. In Persian the dog is referred to as Tazi, which means to run and in Kurdish areas Tazi is also used. Also there are two more places with similar names in Northwest Iran near to the other four locations mentioned in Clark's report. Modern science tells us the origins of all dogs are to the east in China, but we do not know where the origin of the Saluki is located. All along the Silk Road his presence was known for almost as long as the dog has been domesticated, a testimony to his function as a hunter and his beauty as a companion. His image is found in many cultures. There are petroglyphs and rock arts in Golpaygan and Khomein in central Iran that shows saluki-like hounds and falcons accompanying hunters chasing preys (ca. 8000-10,000 BC), recent excavations of the Sumerian empire, estimated at 7000-6000 BC have saluki like finds. Saluki-like images adorn pottery found in Susa. and are found appearing on the Egyptian tombs of 2100 B.C. The nomadic tribes spread the breed across the Middle East from Persia and Egypt, to as far east as Afghanistan and India, and as far south as Sudan.<sup id=""cite_ref-13""> </sup> They were considered to be the ""Royal Dog of Egypt"". Salukis appear on Egyptian tombs increasingly commonly from The Middle Kingdom (2134 BC ? 1785 BC) onward, and have often been found mummified alongside the bodies of the Pharaohs in the Pyramids. It was during the Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt that Salukis rose to their place of prominence, replacing the Tesem (thought to be similar to modern Pariah dogs, or a generic term for a dog). Today, the breed is still held in high regard throughout the Middle East, and have been hunting dogs for nobles and rulers around the region. They are considered clean by the Bedouins, and are allowed to be in women's quarters, while other dogs must be kept outside. Sheik Hamad ibn Isa Al Khalifa, King of Bahrain during the 1930s, was known for a pack of Salukis that accompanied him throughout the Arab world on hunting trips. Following his death, his son Salman ibn Hamad Al Khalifa attempted to keep the lines pure-bred but they became interbred with other breeds. However, the pure-bred lines of the royal kennel were saved by the efforts of Dana Al Khalifa who was given two pure-bred puppies by the King, and about a decade later had around pure-bred Salukis registered with the Kennel Club of Bahrain.<sup id=""cite_ref-goldwasser109_18-0""><sup id=""cite_ref-whelanbahrein_25-1""> </sup></sup> &nbsp; <h2>Description</h2> Salukis are ""sight"" hounds, which means they hunt by sight, run the quarry down, catch it, and kill or retrieve it. The normal size range for the breed is 23?28 inches (58?71 cm) high at thewithers and 40?60 pounds (18?27 kg) in weight, with females being slightly smaller than males. The Saluki's head is long and narrow with large eyes and drop ears. The tail of the breed is long and curved. It has the typical deep-chested, long legged body of the sighthounds. Their coats come in a variety of colors, including white, cream, fawn, red, grizzle and tan, black and tan, and tricolor (white, black and tan). &nbsp; [button link=""http://alphamatch.com/listing-type/pets/?pet-type=1081&amp;breed-2=1035"" color=""black"" type=""big-button"" type=""Search for  Saluki""]Search for Saluki[/button] &nbsp; <h2>Temperament</h2> Historically, Salukis were used by nomadic tribes for hunting. Typical quarry included gazelles, hares, foxes and jackals. In one Bedouin method of hunting hares, the hunter rides close to the quarry on a camel while holding the Saluki, which he throws towards the prey while at speed, giving the dog a running start. Another method, primarily used in hunting gazelles, involved the use of a hawk to gouge out the eyes of the prey, so that a Saluki can then bring down the blinded animal.<sup id=""cite_ref-43""> </sup> A true modern Saluki retains the qualities of hunting hounds and may seem reserved to strangers. An independent and aloof breed, but gentle and affectionate, they can be difficult to train and any such training should be gentle and patient. They can get bored easily, and should not be left at home unattended for long periods. Sensitive and intelligent, the Saluki should never be trained using force or harsh methods, and typically does not enjoy rough games or typical dog games such as chasing sticks. Early socialization is required to prevent timidity and shyness in later life. Given their hunting instincts, they are prone to chasing moving objects. &nbsp; <h2>Health</h2> <div></div> Hip dysplasia is uncommon in Salukis, with the breed ranking joint lowest in a survey by the British Veterinary Association in 2003. The breed scored an average of 5 points, with a score of 0 being low, while 106 is high. In a 2006 breed specific survey conducted by The Kennel Club and the British Small Animal Veterinary Association Scientific Committee, responses highlighted several health issues. The primary cause of death identified was that of cancer, being responsible for 35.6% of deaths, with the most common forms being that of liver cancer or lymphoma. The secondary cause of death was cardiac related, with forms such as heart failure, or unspecified heart defects. Old age is listed as the third most frequent cause of death.<sup id=""cite_ref-kennelsurvey_48-0""> </sup> Cardiomyopathy, heart murmur and other cardiac issues were present in 17.2% of responses while dermatolic conditions such as dermatitis or alopecia were reported by 10.8% of responses.

Fridtjof Nansen believed that the use of sled dogs was the only effective way to explore the north and used Samoyeds on his polar expeditions. His plan to feed the weaker dogs to the stronger ones as the former died during the expedition ultimately consumed nearly all of his dogs. Roald Amundsen used a team of sled dogs led by a Samoyed named Etah on the first expedition to reach the South Pole. Recent DNA analysis of the breed has led to the Samoyed's being included amongst the fourteen most ancient dog breeds, along with Siberian Huskies, Alaskan Malamutes, the Chow Chow, and 10 others of a diverse geographic background. The Samoyeds have been bred and trained for at least 3,000 years. &nbsp; <h2>Temperament</h2> Samoyeds' friendly disposition makes them poor guard dogs; an aggressive Samoyed is rare. With their tendency to bark, however, they can be diligent watch dogs, barking whenever something approaches their territory. Samoyeds are excellent companions, especially for small children or even other dogs, and they remain playful into old age. When Samoyeds become bored, they may begin to dig. With their sled dog heritage, a Samoyed is not averse to pulling things, and an untrained Samoyed has no problem pulling its owner on a leash rather than walking alongside. Samoyeds were also used to herd reindeer. They will instinctively act as herd dogs, and when playing with children, especially, will often attempt to turn and move them in a different direction. The breed is characterized by an alert and happy expression which has earned the nicknames ""Sammie smile"" and ""smiley dog.""

The breed is black, or blonde (some blondes have a silkier coat), and the coat is shiny. Dogs of this breed usually weigh 3?9 kg (7?20 lbs). Puppies are born with tails in different lengths. In Canada and the United States, the tail is usually docked the day after birth. In countries that have bans on docking, Schipperkes display their natural tails, which vary in type. Known for a stubborn, mischievous, and headstrong temperament, it also chases small animals. The Schipperke is sometimes referred to as the ""little black fox"", the ""Tasmanian black devil"", or the ""little black devil"". They are naturally curious and high-energy dogs and require ample exercise and supervision. Schipperkes are very smart and independent; and sometimes debate listening to owners, instead choosing to do whatever benefits them the most, and are not necessarily the proper dog for a first-time dog owner. Schipperkes require training and a secure, fenced-in space to run. They are formidable barkers and can be aggressive with other dogs.

A dog of the peasant farmer for centuries, with the advent of dog showing in the 19th century they finally captured the interest of German dog fanciers, who began to standardize their look and temperament for the show ring.</div> Standard Schnauzers were mixed with the German Black Standard Poodle and the German Pinscher. That's what gives the Standard Schnauzer a ""regal"" look. In the earliest days of the show schnauzer, puppies from a single litter could be classified as either German Pinschers (short haired puppies) or schnauzers (long-coated wire-haired puppies), dependent only on coat length. And before the original German Pinscher breed was wiped out during WWI (it has since been brought back from different stock) the pepper-and-salt coat that is the trademark of the Standard Schnauzer breed in North America could be seen in the German Pincher (called the <i>silberpinsch</i>), attesting to the close relationship between the two breeds in modern times. It was also in the late 19th century that the medium-sized schnauzer was developed into three different breeds/sizes: the Miniature, the Standard (the original), and the Giant. Speaking on the more distant origins of the breed, writers from the late 19th century proposed that the grey Wolfspitz and black German pudles contributed to the early development of the schnauzer, though this has yet to be confirmed through genetic work. The three schnauzer breeds take their name from one of their kind, a medium-sized show dog named ""Schnauzer"", who won at the 1879 Hanover Show in Germany. The word <i>Schnauzer</i> (from the German word for 'snout', recalling the long hair on the muzzle) appeared for the first time in 1842 when used as a synonym for the Wire-haired <i>Pinscher</i> (the name under which the breed first competed at dog shows). The schnauzer was first imported into the United States in the early 1900s. In modern history, the Standard Schnauzer has taken on a variety of roles. The Red Cross used the dogs for guard duty during World War I. Both German and (in one documented instance) American police departments have put the dogs to work as well. Several Standard Schnauzers have been used in the USA for drug and bomb detection, and also as search-and-rescue dogs. The current Standard Schnauzer excels at obedience, agility, tracking, herding, therapy work and, in Germany, schutzhund. Despite being a popular pet in Europe, the Standard Schnauzer has never gained wide popularity in North America. For the past 20 years, the American Kennel Club has registered only ~540 Standard Schnauzer puppies a year (compared with ~100,000 Labrador Retriever puppies each year). &nbsp; <h2>Temperament</h2> The smallest of the working breeds, the Standard schnauzer makes a loyal family dog with guardian instincts. Most will protect their home from uninvited visitors with a deep and robust bark. Originally a German farmdog, they adapt well to any climatic condition, including cold winters. In general, they typically are good with children and were once known in Germany as ""kinderwachters"". If properly trained and socialized early to different ages, races, and temperaments of people, they can be very patient and tolerant in any situation. Like other working dogs, Standard Schnauzers require a fairly strong-willed owner that can be consistent and firm with training and commands. Standard Schnauzers also widely known to be intelligent and easy to train. They have been called ""the dog with a human brain"", and in Stanley Coren's book The Intelligence of Dogs, they are rated 18th out of 80 breeds on the ability to learn new commands and to obey known commands. Standard Schnauzers are extremely versatile, excelling at dog sports such as agility,obedience, tracking, Disc dog, Flyball and herding. Members of the breed have been used in the last 30 years in the United States as for bomb detection, search and rescue, and skin and lung cancer-detection. Like most working dogs, Standard Schnauzers will be rambunctious until about the age of two; and lots of exercise will keep them busy. Owners must be prepared to mentally and physically stimulate their Schnauzer every day, even into their old age. Like other high-intelligence breeds, a bored Schnauzer is a destructive Schnauzer. According to the Standard Schnauzer Club of America, ?The Standard Schnauzer is considered a high-energy dog. They need ample exercise not only for physical well-being, but also for emotional well-being. The minimum amount an adult dog should get is the equivalent of a one long walk a day. This walk should be brisk enough to keep the dog at a steady trotting pace in order to keep the dog in prime physical condition. The Standard Schnauzer puppy is constantly exploring, learning and testing his limits. As adults, they are always ready for a walk in the woods, a ride in the car, a training session or any other activity that allows them to be with their owner. This is a breed that knows how to be on the alert, even when relaxing by the feet of their owner.<sup id=""cite_ref-SSCA1_4-0""> </sup> &nbsp; [button link=""http://alphamatch.com/listing-type/pets/?pet-type=1081&amp;breed-2=1035"" color=""black"" type=""big-button"" type=""Search for  Standard Schnauzer""]Search for Standard Schnauzer[/button] &nbsp; <h3>Grooming</h3> Twice a year, when most other breeds of dog are shedding their coat, a Schnauzer?s coat will become dull and relatively easy to pull out and is said to have ?blown?. At this point the coat can be stripped or pulled out by hand and a new wire coat will re-grow in its place. Stripping is not painful for the dog and can be performed at any stage of hair growth although it is easier to do when the coat is ?blown?. Alternatively, the coat can be regularly clipped with shears. Clipping as opposed to stripping results in a loss of the wiry texture and some of the fullness of the coat. Dogs with clipped fur no longer ?blow? their coat but the coat loses its wiry texture and becomes soft. The fur of clipped dogs tends to be more prone to tangling and knots, particularly when long, and is duller in color than that of stripped coats. In the case of the salt and pepper Schnauzers, the characteristic banded color of the hair is completely lost when maintained through clipping; each shaft of hair becomes entirely gray rather than being banded with multiple shades of gray, white, and black. Clipping is most common in the U.S. as it can be difficult to locate a professional willing to hand strip (the process is quite labor intensive). In Europe, it is very uncommon to see a wire-coated dog which is clipped. It may not be possible to hand strip a poor quality coat, i.e. one that is soft in texture, but soft coats (while relatively common in pet quality Miniature Schnauzers), are not a widespread problem in Standards. Regardless of whether the body of the coat is stripped or clipped the 'furnishings' or longer hair on the legs and face must be scissored or clipped regularly and require daily brushing to remain free of potentially painful mats. Whether a Schnauzer is stripped or clipped, his coat requires a great deal of grooming. In most cases this means an owner must either take care to learn the required grooming - for which the dog's breeder should be a great resource - or the owner must take their dog in for regular, often expensive, trips to a grooming salon. &nbsp; &nbsp;",NULL,NULL,NULL,"Y","0"

On 22 January 1933, one single standard was established for the 4 varieties of the Swiss Hound. Interestingly Adolf Hitler owned one of these dogs, giving it the name ""The Schweizer Luftwaffe"".

They would have been kept by the Scots and Picts, and used to help in providing part of their diet, mainly hoofed game (archaeological evidence likely supports this in the form of Roman pottery from around 1st Century AD found in Argyll which depicts the deerhunt using large rough hounds (these can be viewed at the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh). Other similar evidence can be found on standing stones from around the 7th century AD reflecting a hunt using hounds, such as the Hilton of Cadboll Stone). In outward appearance, the Scottish Deerhound is similar to the Greyhound, but larger and more heavily boned. However, Deerhounds have a number of characteristics that set them apart. While not as fast as a Greyhound on a smooth, firm surface, once the going gets rough or heavy they can outrun a Greyhound. The environment in which they worked, the cool, often wet, and hilly Scottish Highland glens, contributed to the larger, rough-coated appearance of the breed. The Deerhound is closely related to the Irish Wolfhound and was the main contributor to the recovery of that breed when it was re-created at the end of the 19th century. The Deerhound was bred to hunt red deer by ?coursing?, and also ?deer-stalking? until the end of the 19th century. With modern rifles and smaller deer-forests, slower tracking dogs were preferred to fast and far-running Deerhounds. In coursing deer, a single Deerhound or a pair was brought as close as possible to red deer, then released to run one of them down by speed, which if successful would happen within a few minutes - rarely were there sustained chases. With the eventual demise of the clan systems in Scotland, these hunting dogs became sporting animals for landowners and the nobility, but were also bred and hunted by common folk when feasible. As fast and silent hunters they made quick work of any game the size of a hare or larger and were highly regarded by nobility and poachers alike. One of the most precarious times in the breed?s history seems to have been towards the end of the nineteenth century, when many of the large Scottish estates were split into small estates for sporting purposes, and few then kept Deerhounds. The new fashion was for stalking and shooting, which required only a tracking dog to follow the wounded animal, using a collie or similar breed. Although a few estates still employed Deerhounds for their original work, the breed was left in the hands of a few enthusiasts who made them a show breed. In Australia, deerhounds have been used to hunt the kangaroo and wild boar. In addition, according to Teddy Roosevelt in ""Hunting the Grisley and Other Sketches"", some Canadian and American wolf hunters used them. &nbsp; [button link=""http://alphamatch.com/listing-type/pets/?pet-type=1081&amp;breed-2=1035"" color=""black"" type=""big-button"" type=""Search for  Scottish Deerhound""]Search for Scottish Deerhound[/button] &nbsp; <h2>Description</h2> The Scottish Deerhound resembles a rough-coated Greyhound. It is however, larger in size and bone. Height of males from 30 to 32 inches (75?80 cm) or more, weight 85 to 110 pounds (40?50 kg); height of females from 28 inches (70 cm) upwards, weight from 75 to 95 pounds (35?43 kg). It is one of the tallest sighthounds, with a harsh 3-4 inch long coat and mane, somewhat softer beard and moustache, and softer hair on breast and belly. It has small, dark ""rose"" ears which are soft and folded back against the head unless held semi-erect in excitement. The harsh, wiry coat in modern dogs is only seen in self-coloured various shades of gray (blue-gray is preferred). Historically, Deerhounds also could be seen with true brindle, yellow, and red fawn coats, or combinations. 19th century Scottish paintings tend to indicate these colours were associated with a wire haired coat, but, with show breeders preferring a longer coat, these genes now appear to be lost. A white chest and toes are allowed, and a slight white tip to the tail; a white blaze on the head or a white collar are not accepted. The head is long, skull flat, with little stop and a tapering muzzle. The eyes are dark, dark brown or hazel in colour. The teeth should form a level, complete scissor bite. The long straight or curved tail, well covered with hair, should almost reach the ground. &nbsp; <h2>Temperament</h2> The Scottish Deerhound is gentle and extremely friendly. The breed is famed for being docile and eager to please, with a bearing of gentle dignity. It is however a true sighthound which has been selected for generations to pursue game; consequently, most Deerhounds will be eager to chase. The Deerhound needs considerable exercise when young to develop properly and to maintain its health and condition. That does not mean it needs a large house to live in; however it should have regular access to free exercise in a fenced or otherwise ""safe"" area. Deerhounds should not be raised with access only to leash walking or a small yard, this would be detrimental to their health and development. City dwellers with conviction, however, can keep the dog both healthy and happy, as long as they are willing to take their Deerhounds to nearby parks for lengthy runs and rigorous fetching sessions within these wider running courses. Young Deerhounds can sometimes, depending on the individual, be quite destructive especially when they are not given sufficient exercise; however, the average adult Deerhound may want to spend most of the day stretched out on the floor or a couch sleeping. They do require a stimulus, preferably another Deerhound, and a large area to exercise properly and frequently .

There is disagreement over whether the Skye Terriers mentioned in early 16th century records actually descended from forerunners of the Scottie or vice versa. It is certain, however, that Scotties and West Highland White Terriers are closely related ? both their forefathers originated from the Blackmount region of Perthshire and the Moor of Rannoch. Scotties were originally bred to hunt and kill vermin on farmsand to hunt badgers and foxes in the Highlands of Scotland.<sup id=""cite_ref-3""> </sup> The actual origin of a breed as old as the Scottish Terrier is obscure and undocumented. The first written records about a dog of similar description to the Scottish Terrier dates from 1436, when Don Leslie described them in his book <i>The History of Scotland 1436-1561</i>. Two hundred years later, Sir Joshua Reynolds painted a portrait of a young girl caressing a dog similar in appearance to the modern-day Scottie. King James VI of Scotland was an important historical figure featuring in the Scottish Terrier's history. In the 17th century, when King James VI became James I of England, he sent six terriers ? thought to be forerunners of the Scottish terrier ? to a French monarch as a gift. His love and adoration for the breed increased their popularity throughout the world.<sup id=""cite_ref-choosing_1-1""> </sup> Many dog writers after the early 19th century seem to agree that there were two varieties of terrier existing in Britain at the time ? a rough-haired so-called Scotch Terrier and a smooth-haired English Terrier. Thomas Brown, in his <i>Biological Sketches and Authentic Anecdotes of Dogs</i> (1829), states that ""the Scotch terrier is certainly the purest in point of breed and the (smooth) English seems to have been produced by a cross from him"". Brown went on to describe the Scotch Terrier as ""low in stature, with a strong muscular body, short stout legs, a head large in proportion to the body"" and was ""generally of a sandy colour or black"" with a ""long, matted and hard"" coat. Although the Scotch Terrier described here is more generic than specific to a breed, it asserts the existence of a small, hard, rough-coated terrier developed for hunting small game in the Scottish Highlands in the early 19th century; a description that shares characteristics with what was once known as the Aberdeen Terrier and is today known as the Scottish Terrier. In addition, the paintings of Sir Edwin Landseer and an 1835 lithograph entitled ""Scottish Terriers at Work on a Cairn in the West Highlands"" both depict Scottie type terriers very similar to those described in the first Scottish Terrier Standard.<sup id=""cite_ref-mactavish_5-1""> </sup> &nbsp; <h2>Description</h2> The Scottish Terrier is a small, compact, short-legged, sturdily-built terrier of good bone and substance. He has a hard, wiry, weather-resistant coat and a thick-set, cobby body which is hung between short, heavy legs. These characteristics, joined with his very special keen, piercing, ""varminty"" expression, and his erect ears and tail are salient features of the breed. The Scottish Terrier's bold, confident, dignified aspect exemplifies power in a small package. The eyes should be small, bright and piercing, and almond-shaped not round. The color should be dark brown or nearly black, the darker the better. The ears should be small, prick, set well up on the skull and pointed, but never cut. They should be covered with short velvety hair.<sup id=""cite_ref-STCA_Breed_Standard_16-0""> </sup> Height at withers for both genders should be roughly 25 cm (9.8 in), and the length of back from withers to tail is roughly 28 cm (11 in). Generally a well-balanced Scottie dog should weigh from 8.5 to 10 kg (19 to 22 lb) and a female from 8 to 9.5 kg (18 to 21 lb). It is about 10 to 11 inches (25 to 28 cm) in height.<sup id=""cite_ref-weight_17-0""> </sup> The Scottish Terrier typically has a hard, wiry outer coat with a soft, dense undercoat. The coat should be trimmed and blended into the furnishings to give a distinct Scottish Terrier outline. The longer coat on the beard, legs and lower body may be slightly softer than the body coat but should not be or appear fluffy.<sup id=""cite_ref-STCA_Breed_Standard_16-1""> </sup> The coat colours range from dark gray to jet black, or brindle, a mix of black and brown. Scotties with wheaten (straw to nearly white) coats sometimes occur, and are similar in appearance to the Soft-Coated Wheaten Terrier or West Highland White Terrier.

The breed is known to be independent and self-assured, playful, intelligent and has been nicknamed the 'Diehard' because of its rugged nature and endless determination. The 'Diehard' nickname was originally given to it in the 19th century by George, the fourth Earl of Dumbarton. The Earl had a famous pack of Scottish Terriers, so brave that they were named ?Diehards?. They were supposed to have inspired the name of his Regiment, The Royal Scots, ""Dumbarton?s Diehards"".<sup id=""cite_ref-mactavish_5-8""> </sup> Scotties, while being described as very loving, have also been described as stubborn. They are sometimes described as an aloof breed, although it has been noted that they tend to be very loyal to their family and are known to attach themselves to one or two people.<sup id=""cite_ref-canismajor_6-1""> </sup> It has been suggested that the Scottish Terrier can make a good watchdog due to its tendency to bark only when necessary and because it is typically reserved with strangers, although this is not always the case. They have been described as a fearless breed that may be aggressive around other dogs unless introduced at an early age. Scottish Terriers were originally bred to hunt and fight badgers.

According to research by the Veterinary Medical Data Program (1986), six cancers that Scotties appeared to be more at risk for (when compared to other breeds) are: (in descending order) bladder cancer and other transitional cell carcinomas of the lower urinary tract; malignant melanoma;gastric carcinoma; squamous cell carcinoma of the skin; lymphosarcoma and nasal carcinoma. Other cancers that are known to commonly affect Scotties include mast cell sarcoma and hemangiosarcoma.<sup id=""cite_ref-cancer1_25-0""> </sup> Research has suggested that Scottish Terriers are 20 times more likely to get bladder cancer than other breeds and the most common kind of bladder cancer is transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder (TCC). Dr. Deborah Knapp of Purdue University School of Veterinary Medicine has commented ""TCC usually occurs in older dogs (average age 11 years) and is more common in females (2:1 ratio of females to males)."" Symptoms of TCC are blood in the urine, straining to urinate, and frequent urination ? although owners noticing any of these symptoms should also be aware that the same symptoms may also be indicative of a urinary tract infection.<sup id=""cite_ref-cancer_23-3""> </sup> The most common and effective form of treatment for TCC is Piroxicam, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug that ""allows the cancer cells to kill themselves."" In order to help prevent cancer in a dog, an owner should ensure that their dog has minimal exposure to herbicides, pesticides, solvents and cigarette smoke; use caution when treating dogs with some flea medications; provide a healthy, vitamin-rich diet (low in carbohydrates, high in vegetables) and plenty of exercise.<sup id=""cite_ref-preventions_27-0""> </sup> &nbsp; [button link=""http://alphamatch.com/listing-type/pets/?pet-type=1081&amp;breed-2=1035"" color=""black"" type=""big-button"" type=""Search for Scottish Terrier<span style=""line-height: 1.5em;"">""]Search for Scottish Terrier[/button]</span> &nbsp;",NULL,NULL,NULL,"Y","0"

Originally the breed was used for pest control, to hunt small game and to eliminate vermin particularly badgers which he usually relocated. The Welsh Corgi, Fox Terrier (Wire), and the now extinct English White Terrier all played a part in the make up of the Sealyham, although Edwardes did not keep records. He wanted a small white dog with a strong jaw, and a wiry coat. The white coat was particularly prized, as it meant that the hunter in the field could distinguish the dogs from the quarry. Edwardes culled weak dogs, and bred the stronger ones. After Edwardes' death in 1891, other breeders began to work with Sealyhams, including Fred Lewis who promoted the breed.<sup id=""cite_ref-kcsealyhaminfo_3-1""> </sup> The breed was shown for the first time in 1903, and the Sealyham Terrier club was created in 1908; the breed was officially recognised by the Kennel Club in 1911. The Sealyham Terrier now is recognised by all of the major kennel clubs in the English-speaking world. During the early stages of its recognition, the breed was alternatively known as the Welsh Border Terrier, or the Cowley Terrier. The American Sealyham Terrier Club was founded in 1913.<sup id=""cite_ref-6""> </sup> During the 1920s and 1930s, Sir Jocelyn Lucas used the dogs to hunt badgers which he usually relocated. At this time he also used Sealyham Terriers for hunting otters, stoats and squirrels. Deciding that he wanted a better hunting dog than the Sealyhams, bred for conformation showing, he cross-bred the dogs with the Norfolk Terrier. This resulted in an unrecognised breed of dog he called the Lucas Terrier, which he described as ""death to rats and rabbits"".<sup id=""cite_ref-countrylifesos_2-3""> </sup> &nbsp; <h2>Appearance</h2> Sealyhams measurements vary by breed standard according to particular countries. The Kennel Club breed standard states that the height of a Sealyham Terrier should not exceed 12 inches (30 cm), measured at the withers or at the top of the shoulder blade. The ideal weight for a Sealyham is 8 kilograms (18 lb) for females, or 9 kilograms (20 lb) for males.<sup id=""cite_ref-17""> </sup> They have a white double coat which requires regular brushing with a wire comb in order to prevent matting. It has a dense undercoat, while the outer coat is wiry and weather resistant. Markings on the face can be in a variety of colours including lemon, black, brown, blue, and badger, which is a mix of brown and black. Heavy body markings or patches or excessive ticking on the coat are discouraged. Sealyhams are low to the ground, and in muddy weather their long coats can become quite dirty. Sealyham coats are groomed by hand stripping, in order to keep the coat from becoming too soft.<sup id=""cite_ref-21""> </sup> &nbsp; <h2>Temperament</h2> Although happy in the company of others, they are fine if left alone. Sealyham Terriers are suited for both the town and country. They can be stubborn, vocaland boisterous but also full of personality. Whilst they make for loyal family companions, they can be trained to be working dogs, making them excellent mousers or ratters. They can also be taught as a puppy to get along with other animals, including cats and birds. Harry Parsons, described his Sealyhams thus: ""They make great companions, and the way they bond with their owners is almost magical. I keep six indoors, and if someone rings about an infestation and asks us to go ratting, they will know and are out of the door in a millisecond. If you train them, they'll retrieve.

It comes in both short-haired and wire-haired varieties. It is thought to be an ancient breed, descended in pre-Roman eras from progenitor scenthounds in ancient Egypt. The Segugio is a square dog, whose length should be equal to its height at the withers. It is fawn-coloured or black and tan. The dogs are 45?52 cm tall at the withers and roughly 20?23 kg in weight. Its determination to track a scent is similar to that of a Bloodhound, but unlike the Bloodhound the Segugio is also interested in the capture and kill of its victim. In 2009 ENCI (the Italian Kennel Club) registered 4,500 specimens of the short-haired variety and 1,740 wire-haired specimens,<sup id=""cite_ref-1"">[1]</sup> making this one of the top ten breeds in Italy. Its popularity in Italy is due to its outstanding performance as a hunter of game. Although Italians also use other hound breeds, such as Ariegeois, Petit Gascon Santongeois, Porcelaine, Posavatz and Istrian Hounds, the Segugio Italiano has remained the choice of most Italian hunters due to its exceptional abilities. Hunters who hunt hare alone or in small groups find this dog to be ideal. The Segugio Italiano can also hunt larger game, such as wild boar (although it not considered a specialist for this quarry), wild sheep or goats or ungulates of the deer family. The Segugio Italiano works alone or in packs, depending on the quarry. This dog is first and foremost a working dog, and it is rarely kept as only a pet.

Later they became popular in New England when Seppala raced there and ran a kennel in Poland Spring, Maine.<sup> </sup> In 1939 the last Siberia imports, along with several of Seppala?s dogs, became the breed foundation for the ?Siberian Huskie? in Canada. The Canadian Seppala Kennels of Harry R. Wheeler in St. Jovite Station, Quebec, developed and bred Seppala Siberians until 1950 in genetic isolation from the developing Siberian Husky breed in the USA, which gradually became oriented more and more toward conformation dog shows. A succession of Seppala breeders kept the strain alive through the 1950s and 1960s.<sup> </sup> In 1963, the third Seppala Kennels, run by C. S. MacLean and J. D. McFaul in Maniwaki, Quebec, closed without a successor kennel and by 1969 the unique Leonhard Seppala strain faced extinction. It was primarily saved by the timely action of two breeders: Markovo Kennels in Canada and Seppineau Kennels in the USA. The bloodline was then carried forward and developed as a serious mid-distance racing sleddog by Douglas W. Willett of Sepp-Alta Kennels in the state of Utah. The pure, original Seppala bloodlines are rare but found in small numbers in several Canadian provinces, the main population now occurring in Manitoba where the parent kennel relocated in 2008.<sup> </sup> &nbsp; <h3>Temperament</h3> The defining characteristics of the breed are its natural, primitive appearance, its highly developed work ethic, and its affectionate, cooperative, and highly bonded nature. They tend to be more trainable than other sled dogs and to be more highly bonded to their owners. The Seppala Siberian Sleddog disposition is active, merry, and often quite inquisitive, although sometimes showing great reserve with strangers. A stable and serious temperament, neither nervous nor aggressive, is characte &nbsp; <h3>Appearance</h3> Seppalas of today differ markedly from many other Siberian Husky bloodlines in physical appearance, being in general less flashily marked, longer in leg and body length, and lighter in weight and physical build than most Siberian Husky show dog lines. Pure-strain Seppalas have dense, smooth coats of medium length with an undercoat nearly as long as the guard hairs. Their ears are taller, set close together and strongly erect, the ""stop"" of the head less well-defined than that of Siberian Huskies. The tail is held high in a sickle curve over the back when alert, never ""snapped"" flat to the back or curling down the flank. Many Seppalas are pure white or buff and white. Others are very dark, black, or charcoal grey with dark faces and white only on the feet and tail tip. There are many varied shades of grey, brownish grey, and blue-grey. ?Sable? reds with black-tipped guard hairs and black noses occur, but the liver-nosed ?copper? phase seen in other lines of Siberian Huskies is unknown in pure Seppalas. Agouti ""wild type"" coloration and piebald spotting are common. Seppalas are known for their extremely smooth and well-coordinated gait and for the consistency and strength with which they pull in harness. Although they appear to the inexperienced eye to be rather small and lightly built for sleddogs, actually they are far more efficient pullers than some larger northern breeds. They are capable racing sleddogs, particularly in mid-distance events, although perhaps not as speedy as world-class Alaskan huskies or pointer-crossed hybrids.<sup> </sup> Like other northern breeds, they shed their coats hugely once or twice a year, cannot safely be allowed to run free off leash, and love to hunt small game. They are generally robust and healthy, living twelve to sixteen years, usually working well in harness up to ten or eleven years of age. Health issues for the breed are those common to all northern breeds, such as allergies, cancer and eye problems. They are highly efficient in their use of food, eating relatively little but requiring very high-quality nutrition that is rich in animal protein, animal fat, and fish oil.<sup> </sup> [button link=""http://alphamatch.com/listing-type/pets/?pet-type=1081&amp;breed-2=1035"" color=""black"" type=""big-button"" type=""Search for Seppala Siberian Sleddog""]Search for Seppala Siberian Sleddog[/button]",NULL,NULL,NULL,"Y","0"

The original Shar-Pei from China looked very different from the breed now popular in the West. People in southern China, Hong Kong, and Macau differentiate the Western type and the original type by calling them respectively 'meat-mouth' and 'bone-mouth' Shar-Pei. The ancestry of the Shar-Pei is uncertain. It may be a descendant of the Chow Chow; however, the only clear link between these is the blue-black tongue. However, pictures on pottery suggest the breed was present even in the Han Dynasty (206 BC). A statue on display at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts dating from the second century A.D. depicts a dog that strongly resembles a modern Shar Pei. For many years, the Shar-Pei was kept as a general-purpose farm dog in the Chinese countryside, used for hunting, protecting and herding stock and guarding the home and family. During that time, the Shar-Pei was bred for intelligence, strength and scowling face. Recent genetic research has suggested the Shar-Pei is one of a few oldest dog breeds, believed to have split from common ancestors earlier than other breeds. By mapping subtle differences in each breed?s genes, searching for patterns of relationships and designing a tree to fit them, they could finally gain insight into this marvel of evolutionary engineering. In 2004, the foundational analysis of purebred dog genetics was published in Science. The resulting tree was profoundly asymmetrical. After wolves, just four groups sat its base: Asia?s shar-pei, along with shiba inu, akita and chow chow; central Africa?s basenji; malamutes from the Arctic, along with Siberian huskies and samoyeds; and from the Middle East, Afghan hounds and salukis. Later, it was used for dog fighting. The loose skin and extremely prickly coat were developed originally to help the Shar Pei fend off wild boar, as they were used to hunt. Dog fighters used these enhanced traits to make the Shar-Pei difficult for its opponent to grab and hold on to, and so that if it did manage to hold on, the Shar-Pei would still have room to maneuver and bite back. The Shar-Pei's most intriguing feature, in this respect, is that if one grabs them by any loose wrinkle, they can actually twist in their skin and face in one's direction. This trait was used in fighting as a means for them to fight back; they would be bitten and twist in their skin to bite back at the offender. During the Communist Revolution, when the Shar Pei population dwindled dramatically, dogs were rescued by a Hong Kong businessman named Matgo Law, who appealed to Americans in 1973 through a dog magazine to save the breed. Around 200 Shar-Peis were smuggled into America. The current American Shar Pei population stems mainly from these original 200. DNA analysis has concluded that the Shar Pei is one of the most ancient dog breeds.<sup id=""cite_ref-8""> </sup> &nbsp; <h3>Temperament</h3> All Shar-Pei puppies need early socialization with children, strangers, and other animals. Like other fighting breeds, they can be stubborn, strong-willed and very territorial. Early training can help control these traits before they become problem behaviors. Some people may experience a sensitivity to the harshness of the coat of either length. This is a mild, short-lived rash that can develop on the skin that has been in contact with the coat, most commonly on the forearms. The Shar Pei is often suspicious of strangers, which pertains to their origin as a guard dog. It is a very independent and reserved breed. Nevertheless, the Shar Pei is extremely devoted, loyal and affectionate to its family and is amenable to accepting strangers given time and proper introduction at a young age. If poorly socialized or trained, it can become especially territorial and aggressive. Even friendly and well-socialized individuals will retain the breed's watch dog proclivities (like barking at strangers). It is a largely silent breed, barking only when it is playing or worried. The Shar-Pei were originally bred as palace guards in China. The breed is amenable to training but can be very stubborn. With repetition and a clear reward system, training is not very difficult. Overall, the Shar Pei can be a dog that is loyal and loving to its family while being very protective and independent.

This resulted not only in a dramatically different look for the Shar-Pei (as its most distinctive features, including its wrinkles and rounded snout, were greatly exaggerated), but also in a large number of health problems. Allergy-induced skin infections can be a problem in this breed. Familial Shar Pei fever (FSF) is a serious congenital disease that causes short fevers lasting up to 24 hours, usually accompanied by accumulation of fluid around the ankles (called Swollen Hock Syndrome). These fevers may or may not recur at more frequent intervals and become more intense. Amyloidosis, a long-term condition, is most likely related to FSF, caused by unprocessed amyloid proteins depositing in the organs, most often in the kidneys or liver, leading eventually to renal failure. There is no early test for FSF, but as it is congenital, the dog is either born with it or without it, and if one attack occurs (usually brought on by excessive emotional or physical stress), the dog will always be susceptible to another. With proper care, a Shar-Pei with FSF can live a completely normal and long life. The disease is associated with the western type and it is estimated that 23% are affected. The Australian breed standard was changed in 2009 to discourage breeding for heavy wrinkling.<sup id=""cite_ref-5""> </sup> A common problem is a painful eye condition, entropion, in which the eyelashes curl inward, irritating the eye. Untreated, it can cause blindness. This condition can be fixed by surgery (""tacking"" the eyelids up so they will not roll onto the eyeball for puppies or surgically removing extra skin in adolescent and older Shar Pei). In Australia, more than 8 in 10 Shar Peis require surgery to correct eye problems.<sup id=""cite_ref-7""> </sup> The Shar-Pei is also prone to chronic yeast infections in its ears. This is due to the tight ""flap"" that the ear creates over the canal, allowing a moist environment.<sup> </sup> Vitamin B-12 deficiency is a common problem in the Shar Pei and is suspected to be hereditary.<a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S109002331100181X"" rel=""nofollow""> </a> &nbsp;",NULL,NULL,NULL,"Y","0"

The original sheepdog of Shetland was a Spitz-type dog, probably similar to the modern Icelandic sheepdog. This dog was crossed with mainland working collies brought to the islands, and then after being brought to England, it was further extensively crossed with the Rough Collie, and other breeds including some or all of the extinct Greenland Yakki, the King Charles Spaniel (not the Cavalier), thePomeranian, and possibly the Border Collie. The original Spitz-type working sheepdog of Shetland is now extinct, having been replaced for herdingthere by the Border Collie. The Shetland Sheepdog in its modern form has never been used as a working dog on Shetland, and ironically it is uncommon there.<sup> </sup> When the breed was originally introduced breeders called them Shetland Collies, which upset Rough Collie breeders, so the name was changed to Shetland Sheepdog. During the early 20th century (up until the 1940s), additional crosses were made to Rough Collies to help retain the desired Rough Collie type ? in fact, the first AKC Sheltie champion's dam was a purebred rough Collie.<sup> </sup> The year 1909, marked the initial recognition of the Sheltie by the English Kennel Club, with the first registered Sheltie being a female called Badenock Rose. The first Sheltie to be registered by the American Kennel Club was ""Lord Scott"" in 1911.<sup id=""cite_ref-history_8-0""> </sup> &nbsp; <h2>Temperament</h2> The Shetland sheepdog is lively, intelligent, playful, trainable, and willing to please and obey. They are loving, loyal, and affectionate with their family, but are naturally aloof with strangers; for this reason Shelties must be socialized. Shelties do well with children if they are reared with them from an early age; however, their small size makes it easy for a child to accidentally injure them, so supervision is necessary. Shelties are vocal dogs, and are very alert to outside stimuli. The average Sheltie is an excellent watch dog. The herding instinct is strong in many Shelties. They love to chase and herd things, including squirrels, ducks, children, and if an owner is not watchful, cars. Shelties love to run in wide-open areas. Some Shelties get so excited or anxious that they perform a fast series of tight spins without chasing their tails, a behavior seen in a number of small dog breeds. Neglecting a Sheltie's need for exercise and intellectual stimulation can result in undesirable behaviors, including excessive barking, phobias, and nervousness. Fortunately, the reverse is also true; annoying behaviors can be lessened greatly by an hour of exercise that engages the dog with its owner. They do well with a sensitive, attentive owner. Shelties have a high level of intelligence. According to Dr. Stanley Coren, an expert on animal intelligence, the Shetland sheepdog is one of the brightest dogs, ranking 6th out of 132 breeds tested. His research found that an average Sheltie could understand a new command in less than 5 repetitions and would obey a command the first time it was given 95% of the time or better.<sup id=""cite_ref-17""> </sup> [button link=""http://alphamatch.com/listing-type/pets/?pet-type=1081&amp;breed-2=1035"" color=""black"" type=""big-button"" type=""Search for Shetland Sheepdog""]Search for Shetland Sheepdog[/button] &nbsp; <h2>Health</h2> For the most part, Shelties are athletic and healthy. Like the Rough Collie, there is a tendency toward inherited malformation and disease of the eyes. Each individual puppy should have his eyes examined by a qualified veterinary ophthalmologist. Some lines may be susceptible to hypothyroidism, epilepsy, hip dysplasia, or skin allergies. Shelties are also highly susceptible to Transitional Cell Carcinoma (TCC). TCC is a cancer of the bladder, and can be diagnosed early by regular urinalysis from a normal veterinarian. Causes are debated between breed susceptibility and female gender and exposure to insecticides.<sup id=""cite_ref-18""> </sup> Dermatomyositis may occur at the age of 4 to 6 months, and is frequently misdiagnosed by general practice veterinarians as sarcoptic or demodectic mange. The disease manifests itself as alopecia on the top of the head, supra- and suborbital area and forearms as well as the tip of the tail. If the disease progresses to its more damaging form, it could affect the autonomic nervous system and the dog may have to be euthanised. This disease is generation-skipping and genetically transmitted, with breeders having no clear methodology for screening except clear bloodline records. Deep tissue biopsies are required to definitively diagnose dermatomyositis.<sup id=""cite_ref-19""> </sup> Von Willebrand disease is an inherited bleeding disorder. In Shelties, affected dogs as a general rule are not viable and do not live long. The Sheltie carries type III of von Willebrands, which is the most severe of the three levels. There are DNA tests that were developed to find von Willebrands in Shelties. It can be done at any age, and it will give three results: affected, carrier and non-affected. Shelties may also suffer from hypothyroidism, which is the under-functioning thyroid gland. It is an Autoimmune disease where the immune system attacks the thyroid gland. Clinical symptoms include hair loss or lack of coat, over or under-weight, and listlessness.<sup id=""cite_ref-22""> </sup> Although small breed dogs are not usually plagued by hip dysplasia, it has been identified in Shelties. Hip dysplasia occurs when the head of the femur and the acetabulum do not fit together correctly, frequently causing pain and/or lameness. Hip dysplasia is thought to be genetic. Many breeders will have their dogs' hips x-rayed and certified by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals. &nbsp;",NULL,NULL,NULL,"Y","0"

Originally, the Shiba Inu was bred to hunt and flush small game, such as birds and rabbits. Despite efforts to preserve the breed, the Shiba nearly became extinct during World War II due to a combination of food shortage and a post-war distemper epidemic. All subsequent dogs were bred from the only three surviving bloodlines. These bloodlines were the Shinshu Shiba fromNagano Prefecture, the Mino Shiba from Gifu Prefecture, and the San'in Shiba from Tottori and Shimane Prefectures. The Shinshu Shibas possessed a solid undercoat, with a dense layer of guard-hairs, and were small and red in color. The Mino Shibas tended to have thick, prick ears, and possessed a sickle tail, rather than the common curled tail found on most modern Shibas. The San'in Shibas were larger than most modern shibas, and tended to be black, without the common tan and white accents found on modern black-and-tan shibas. When the study of Japanese dogs was formalized in the early and mid-20th century, these three strains were combined into one overall breed, the Shiba Inu. The first Japanese breed standard for the Shiba, the Nippo Standard, was published in 1934. In December 1936, the Shiba Inu was recognized as a Natural Monument of Japan through the Cultural Properties Act, largely due to the efforts of Nippo (Nihon Ken Hozonkai), the Association for the Preservation of the Japanese Dog.<sup id=""cite_ref-Total_4-5""></sup><sup id=""cite_ref-13""> </sup> In 1954, an armed service family brought the first Shiba Inu to the United States. In 1979, the first recorded litter was born in the United States. The Shiba was recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1992 and added to the AKC Non-Sporting Group in 1993. It is now primarily kept as a pet both in Japan and abroad.<sup id=""cite_ref-k9web_14-0""> </sup> <h3>Temperament</h3> Sometimes, the Shiba tends to show dog aggression. This is more prevalent between female Shibas and is influenced by the breed's strong prey drive. The Shiba Inu is best in a home without other small dogs or young children, but consistent obedience training and early socialization can make all the difference. The breed also interacts fairly well with cats. A spirited boldness, a good nature, and an unaffected forthrightness, which together yield dignity and natural beauty. The Shiba has an independent nature and can be reserved toward strangers but is loyal and affectionate to those who earn his respect. They can be aggressive toward other dogs. The Shiba's frame is compact with well-developed muscles. Males are 14<sup>1</sup>?<sub>2</sub> inches to 16<sup>1</sup>?<sub>2</sub> inches (35?43 cm) at withers. Females are 13<sup>1</sup>?<sub>2</sub> inches to 15<sup>1</sup>?<sub>2</sub> inches (33?41 cm). The preferred size is the middle of the range for each sex.

They are the ideal companion for active outdoor people. They are very energetic and active outside but they are calm and quiet indoors. The Shikoku is a very intelligent dog and a quick learner. They are not as stubborn and independent as the other native Japanese breeds, but still it is not a dog for every person. The Shikoku stands 17?21 inches (43?53 cm) high and comes in sesame (red, black), black and tan (nonstandard color), or cream (nonstandard color). These colors consist usually of a light brown, a light red-brown, or a light black-brown. In addition, there is a cream colored coat that tends to be very rare. In all of these colors there is usually a mixture of white found around the underside of the body, near the eyes, snout, and legs. The Shikoku tends to shed its coat at least one to two times a year. The dog has a fairly thick coat with pointed ears and a curved tail. The body conformation is typically of the spitz-type: the square body, the wedge-shaped head, the prick triangular ears, and feathered curled tail. The Shikoku dog is somewhat unique in its appearance. It looks similar to an Alaskan Husky dog physically, but differs in its size and color. The Shikoku Inu ranges from thirty to fifty-five pounds (male; approximately 20 inches tall; female; approximately 18.5 inches tall). This dog would be considered medium sized. <h2>Health</h2> With a life span of ten to twelve years or so, Shikoku need to be properly taken care of, like every other dog. Health is a big part of the Shikoku's life, because dogs such as these suffer from common illnesses when not given the proper things to eat, or not getting enough time outside. Common illnesses in the Shikoku can appear in the bones, joints, ears, muscles, and nerves. Disease also occurs from things such as trauma and infection. Other more serious issues relate to heart, lung, digestive, and urinary problems.

They developed along the west coastal area, where they hunted fox and otter from among the rocky cairns. The purest of these dogs were found on the Isle of Skye, and the dogs were then named Skye Terriers. Skye Terriers were first described in the sixteenth century, when it was already noteworthy for its long coat. Some confusion exists in tracing its history because, for a certain time, several different breeds had the same name ""Skye Terrier"". The loyal dog, present under the petticoat of Mary, Queen of Scots at her execution, has been ascribed as a Skye Terrier. In 1840, Queen Victoria made the breed fancy, keeping both drop-(floppy) and prick-(upwards) eared dogs. This highly increased its popularity in many of the high societies and among commoners, which are very high class. Soon enough, the Skye Terrier came to America because of its extreme popularity throughout its country and some others. The AKC recognized the breed in 1887, and it quickly rose to the show scene position. Even though this was a strong start and the breed's great appearance, its popularity has dropped. Now it is among one of the least known terriers. Many people are unaware of this breed's old popularity because it is not famous now. <sup id=""cite_ref-2""> </sup> <h2>Health</h2> If a Skye is exercised too often, too young, especially before 8 months, they can damage their bone growth, leading to a painful limp and possibly badly bowed legs. Jumping up and down from objects, climbing over objects, running, even long walks, are all things to be avoided for the first 8 to 10 months to prevent later problems and allow for correct closure of the growth plate. Degenerative disc disease is also a common problem in short-legged dogs, and as many as 10% of Skyes will suffer from it. Mammary cancer is the leading cause of Skye Terrier deaths, with Hemangiosarcomas (a malignant tumour of the blood vessels), Autoimmune disease, and Hyperthyroidism as other concerns of the breed. There are concerns that the breed is under threat of extinction with only 30 born in the UK in 2005 . It is today the most endangered of the Vulnerable Native Breeds of that country, and within 40 years the breed may disappear completely.

It is thought that Sloughis originally came from the Orient or from what is today Ethiopia (the tributes to the Pharaohs included smooth Lop-eared Sighthounds from Nubia, south of Egypt). The Sloughi is one of the two African Sighthound breeds recognized by the FCI. On old fragments of earthenware (about 3000 B.C.), a short-haired sighthound with lop ears was discovered that looks like a Sloughi. Today, the Sloughi is found mainly in Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, and Morocco is responsible for the breed's FCIStandard. It is not to be confused with the smooth Saluki of the Arabian peninsula and the Middle East, which is a variety of the Saluki breed. It is also not to be confused with the smooth Afghan Hound, which is a variety of the Afghan Hound. The Sloughi was and is still used for hunting in its native countries, and is also a reliable guarding dog.</div> &nbsp; <h3>Appearance</h3> The Sloughi belongs to the Sighthound family. In appearance, it is a short-haired, middle-sized, strong sighthound with drooping ears. Its expression is often described to be melancholy. Its muscular system is ""dry"", that is, the Sloughi has flat and long muscles, which must not be as brawny as those of Greyhounds or Whippets, even when in excellent physical condition. Its back is nearly horizontal (the lumbar region must be slightly vaulted). It has a moderate angulation and a tucked up underline. The Sloughi's eyes are ideally dark brown, though sometimes of amber colour. Its coat colour varies from light-sand, to red-sand, red- or mahogany with or without brindling, black mantle,black mask, black ears. According to the standard, a Sloughi may only have a small white patch on its chest. Extensive white markings and parti-colored coats are not allowed. The Sloughi's gait is feather-light, with a moderate and energy-efficient stride. The Sloughi's general view is compact and strong; it may not be too dainty. &nbsp; <h3>Temperament</h3> It is of a sensitive nature yet is an alert and intelligent hound. It is said that Sloughis have a mighty longing for moving and that is not easy to keep them in flats with families; however, a Sloughi does not need more exercise than other dogs of similar size. It loves variety, walking on the leash, romping in the countryside, and racing. A Sloughi is faithful to his owner and it needs him close by. Sloughis are easy to bring up and to train, if you know how to do it. Because the Sloughi is somewhat sensitive, its training should not be oppressive, and any punishment should be omitted. What it likes is a friendly confirmation of its behaviour. &nbsp; <h2>Health</h2> The Sloughi is largely unchanged from ancient times, and so retains a robust genetic health. Only a few genetic conditions have been noted in the breed, in particular Progressive retinal atrophy (PRA). Fortunately the Sloughi is one of the breeds in whom this condition can be tested for with a small blood sample, and breeders are working to eliminate PRA from the gene pool. Like all sighthounds, the Sloughi is very sensitive to anesthesia, and can be sensitive to vaccines, worming, and other medications - so these routine treatments should be spaced apart instead of given all at once. Otherwise the breed tends to enjoy excellent health into old age.

The Slovak Cuvac, together with mountain sheep, the Hucul horse, and typical inhabitants of the mountains, formed the fundamental economic preconditions for the utilization of pastures for cattle. The inhabitants of the Slovak mountains were mostly free people who defended the frontiers and paid duties in sheep's cheese. The institution of these people was called ""Valassky Opasok"" and its center, until the abolition of serfdom, was Ko?ice. The members of this shepherd military system did their service on mountain meadows with their companions - the hearty white dog called the Slovak Cuvac. A good watchdog, guard, shepherd and companion, the dog proved itself also in watching cattle, turkeys, and other domestic animals - as well as its master's household. Holiday makers and visitors to the mountains and spas took to this breed and began to carry it to the lowlands.The Slovensky Cuvac is used on sheep farms and mountain ridges as well as homes and frontiers. He is boundlessly loyal and stout hearted. He resists every enemy - bears and wolves included. According to the time honored shepherd's tradition, he is always bred in white to be discernible from the beasts of the night. This breed has been well documented as far back as the 17th century. However, as wolves slowly began to disappear from European mountains and modern herding practices were instituted, the Cuvac was faced with the prospect of being seen as a relic of the past. What few specimens were left in the 1950s were bred carelessly. Credit for reviving the breed and fixing characteristics is due Dr. Antonin Hruza, in cooperation with the veterinary school of Brno. The registered breeding of the Slovensky Cuvac was established in Czechoslovakia by Professor Antonin Hruza from the Veterinary Faculty in Brno on June 4, 1929. The Club of the Breeders of Slovak Cuvac was established in 1933 and a written standard was established and approved in 1964 Dr. V. Kurz). The basic breeding material came from the vicinity of Liptovska Luzna, Kokava and Vychodna as well as from Rachov in the Carpathians. &nbsp; <h2>Description</h2> The body of Slovak Cuvac is slightly longer than higher.

The coat is of moderate length in any shade between a tweedy gray-brown and the classic pewter-silver coat of the Weimeraner. The eyes may range from the deep amber of the German Wirehaired Pointer to the light shades seen in the Weimaraner. The FCI has developed a detailed standard which states the eyes of juveniles may be ""azure"" but those of adults must be amber. White is permitted on the chest and feet.

They have a loud, strong bark for their size though they do not bark much. <h3>Coat</h3> The coat of the Small Greek Domestic Dog is of good quality, and is easy to groom. There are two types of coats for this dog. One is called the longhaired coat, and the other is called the shorthaired coat. The longhaired coat is the most common now and also the most commonly represented type on ancient artifacts. Sometimes, it is slightly wavy, but it should always feel silky. The coat is rich, dense and weatherproof, coming in all colours.

Quite fearless for their size, they are quite territorial and possessive of their owners. The Small Greek Domestic dogs are ideal companions, extremely expressive, highly perceptive and they sigh and use their eyes like humans. They insist in sleeping in bed with the owners.

They share a common ancestry with the Kerry Blue Terrier and the Irish Terrier, but were not owned by gentry.Today, Wheaten terriers compete in obedience, agility, and tracking, and are occasionally used in animal-assisted therapy, as well. In Ireland, they were commonly referred to as the ""Poor Man's Wolfhound."" Their tails used to be docked to avoid taxes, and were often kept to a specific size.<sup id=""cite_ref-6""> </sup> Despite its long history, the Wheaten was not recognised as a breed in Ireland by the Irish Kennel Club until 1937. In 1943, the British Kennel Club recognised the breed in the UK, as well. The first Wheatens were exported to Lydia Vogel in the United States in the 1940s, but serious interest in the breed took another ten years to develop. Finally, in 1973, they were recognised by the American Kennel Club. In the 1970s, the first Wheatens were imported into Australia by Anubis Kennels. Since then, many more have been imported. Recent importation of Irish-style dogs have improved and broadened the gene pool. &nbsp; <h2>Appearance</h2> Puppies have dark coats of either red, brown, mahogany or white. Their muzzles and ears may be black or dark brown. The dark puppy coat gradually grows out to nearly white before maturing into a wheaten-coloured coat as they get older. The adult coat may contain black, white, or darker brown ""guard"" hairs in addition to the lighter wheaten-coloured hair. If adults ever have skin injuries, the resulting hair growth will be the dark color of their puppy coat before it eventually grows out to the wheat color. The Soft-coated Wheaten Terrier is a medium-sized dog, which ranges on average from 17 to 19 inches in height and about 30 to 45 pounds in weight. The breed has a square structure and is well built. Its hair does not shed like most dogs; like human hair and Poodle hair, it keeps growing; they do need trimming and should be brushed and combed once a day to avoid mats. They are very smart dogs, and are easy to train. They love people, and they rarely have aggression issues.<sup id=""cite_ref-Gopets_8-0""> </sup> The Irish coat tends to be thinner and silkier than the American variety. The Irish coat has a devoted following in Ireland and Europe. Breeders of the pure Irish type believe this is the original working terrier coat.

There are a few breeders of the Irish type in the US and Canada. In the AKC conformation show ring, the judges do not always accept the Irish type well. The Irish is well received in the UK and Europe. The ""Heavy Irish"" coat is usually a result of cross breeding between coat types ? American/English coat with an Irish type. The Irish coat still requires daily brushing to stay free of matted hair. The Wheatens seen in Ireland today are of the same size, shape and coat texture as those seen and documented well over 100 years ago. Evidence of this can be seen from the famous artwork ""The Aran Fisherman's Drowned Child"" by Frederic William Burton.

It requires patience and consistent positive training. Harsh methods will often result in fear and/or aggression. A positive, even-handed approach works best with this intelligent yet headstrong terrier. It is an enthusiastic greeter, and will often jump up to lick a person's face, commonly referred to as the ""Wheaten greetin"". Wheatens are considered less scrappy than other terriers, but they are true terriers and will be more active than many other breeds. For this reason these dogs do best when they are exercised regularly. They are cool weather dogs and can become easily overheated in hot weather. If socialised with cats and puppies, they may get along fine with them; if not, care should be taken in introducing them to cats, as the breed has a very strong ""prey drive"" because of its vermin-hunting origin. Wheatens can get along well with other dogs if properly socialised. They are extremely friendly and loving pets. Wheatens are very protective of their families and, although they may bark an alert at strangers, they rarely get aggressive.

The exact date of its extinction is not known; it is likely that it was gradually interbred with other breeds until the genuine Southern Hound bloodline ceased to exist. The origins of the Southern Hound are equally unclear. Most writers suggest that it is derived from the Talbot, which was a predominantly white, slow, deep-throated,scent hound, also of uncertain origin, though it is sometimes claimed that it came from Normandy. It is suggested that at some point the Talbot was crossed withGreyhounds to give them an extra turn of speed. However, in <i>The Dog</i> published in 1852, William Youatt states that the Southern Hound may have existed in Britain since ancient times rather than being brought from France by the Normans.<sup id=""cite_ref-Youatt_2-0""> </sup> The Southern Hound was a tall, heavy dog with a square head, and long ears. It had a deep chest, a long bony body and a deep melodious voice. It was a slow dog, but with excellent scenting abilities and was employed to follow the trail of the quarry during a hunt. Because of its lack of speed and deliberate nature, it was considered best used for hunting game such as hare or deer, which would eventually be exhausted by its relentless pursuit but, unlike a fox or rabbit, could not escape to the safety of a den or burrow. The Southern Hound seems to have fallen out of favour during the 18th century as the fashion for shorter hunts led to the development of the faster Foxhound. Youatt wrote that there were still packs in use in Devon in the 19th century and that the Southern Hound was sometimes used in conjunction with Foxhound packs to help pick up the cold trail when the pack lost the scent. Some were employed in Wales on polecat hunts (that could last several days), and they appear to have been used to hunt otter before being employed as breeding stock for the development of the Otterhound.<sup id=""cite_ref-4""> </sup> The famous bloodhound breeder Edwin Brough reported that in 1881 he used a pure bred Southern Hound, 'Clara', (pictured in this article) as a cross to his bloodhounds, and this outcross was bred on from into the modern population of bloodhounds.<sup id=""cite_ref-bloodhounds_5-0""> </sup> Many of the modern hound breeds are believed to have Southern Hound blood: Beagles, Harriers, Foxhounds, Coonhounds and Bloodhounds among others.",NULL,NULL,NULL,"Y","0"

The St. John?s dog was also an ancestor to the large and gentle Newfoundland dog, probably through breeding with mastiffs brought to the island by the generations of Portuguese fishermen who had been fishing offshore since the 15th century. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, St. John's dogs were exported from Newfoundland to England. These dogs were cross-bred with other breeds to create the retrievers. <h2>Extinction</h2> The St. John's dog was made extinct in its homeland by a combination of two factors. In an attempt to encourage sheep raising, heavy restrictions and taxes were placed on dog ownership during the 19th century. Also their main overseas destination, the UK, imposed rigorous long-term quarantine on all imported animals, especially dogs (1885) as part of the eradication of rabies. However, in both Newfoundland and the Maritime provinces, there are still large black mixed-breed dogs with many characteristics of the original St. John's dog. The 6th Duke of Buccleuch reportedly managed to import a few St. John's dogs between 1933?1934 and continued to retain as pure a version of the landrace as possible in the Buccleuch Labrador (as the Dukes do to this day), but the variety continued to dwindle. The last two known St. John's dogs were photographed in the early 1980s (in old age) having survived in a ""very remote area"", but both were male, bringing the St. John's water dog to an end. In the 1970s, Canadian author Farley Mowat had tried to save them by crossing his St. John's, named ""Albert"", with a Labrador. Four puppies resulted, and all had the distinctive white markings of their sire. Two puppies died, the other two were given away. One was given to Canadian prime minister Pierre Trudeau and the other to Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin. In 1970, Mowat and Albert appeared in an episode of the CBC series <i>Telescope</i>.

In earlier days it was used for hunting foxes, small game, and birds. While on farms, Stabyhouns exhibited fine skills as a mole-catcher. During the hunting season, it was used as an all-round gundog. Today, the Stabyhoun remains a competent hunter, although British and German breeds are more popular. It is a fine pointer, an excellent tracker, and also a good watchdog. It has also been used as a draught dog. Historically, these dogs were nearly exclusively owned by farmers, whose limited financial means dictated the need for an all-around working and hunting breed. Due to their versatility, Stabyhouns have been used as a guard dog on farms despite their origins as a gundog. The breed's appearance and purpose have not changed in decades. In earlier days the Stabyhoun was often mixed with another Friesian breed, theWetterhoun, in order to optimize the traits of these working dogs. However, in 1942 the Stabyhoun received official breed recognition, and crossbreedingbetween the Stabyhoun and Wetterhoun has ceased. <h3>Temperament</h3> The Stabyhoun has a gentle disposition. This breed is friendly, sensitive, intelligent, peaceful, patient, and willing to please, but has a reputation for being stubborn and very vigilant. The Stabyhoun exhibits great tolerance of children and other animals. With steady yet gentle training, this breed will be obedient and devoted to its owner. Stabyhouns should never be vicious or snappy. The breed needs regular exercise, which makes the Stabyhoun best suited for active owners who spend ample time outdoors. Although a Stabyhoun can be very calm indoors, like all sporting breeds, it requires plenty of physical activity. Due to its strong retrieving instinct, a Stabyhoun is happy to spend the whole day playing fetch with its owner.

Bulls brought to market were set upon by dogs as a way of tenderizing the meat and providing entertainment for the spectators; and dog fights with bears, bulls and other animals were often organised as entertainment for both royalty and commoners. Early Bull and Terriers were not bred to resemble the companion animals of today, but for the characteristic known as gameness, with the pitting of dogs against bear or bull and exotic animals testing this attribute along with the strength and skill of the dog. These early ""proto-staffords"" provided the ancestral foundation stock for the Staffordshire Bull Terrier, the Bull Terrier, the American Pit Bull Terrier and American Staffordshire Terrier. This common ancestor was known as the ""Bull and Terrier"". These bloodsports were officially eliminated in 1835 as Britain began to introduce animal welfare laws. Since dogfights were cheaper to organise and far easier to conceal from the law than bull or bear baits, bloodsport proponents turned to pitting their dogs against each other instead. Dog fighting was used as both a bloodsport (often involving gambling) and a way to continue to test the quality of their stock. For decades afterward, dog fighting clandestinely took place in pockets of Britain and America. Dogs were released into a pit, and the last dog still fighting (or occasionally, the last dog surviving) was recognised as the winner. The quality of pluckiness or ""gameness"" was still highly prized, and dogs that gave up during a fight were reviled as ""curs."" Despite being trained to be aggressive towards fellow dogs, they had to be of good temperament with people as the handler would have to bring the dog back to scratch for each round.<sup> </sup> As time went on the modern breed has become one with a temperament suitable for a pet and companion. It gained respectability, becoming a dog worthy to show, and was accepted by The Kennel Club of the United Kingdom as the Staffordshire bull terrier in 1935.

Before a hunt, the dogs were ceremonially bled by stabbing them in the hindquarters with the fibula bone of a fox or wolf. The morning of the hunt, two dogs were carried in a sack over the Native's shoulder until fresh bear tracks were sighted. Upon release, these little dogs moved lightly over the crust of snow while the bear was slowed down by the deep drifts. Their fox-like staccato yaps harassed the bear into submission or confused him until the Natives could come close enough for a kill. To prepare for a foray against big cats, a claw from a dead lynx was used to ceremonially mark the dog's face. The Tahltan Bear Dog had the courage to face a bear, but was friendly and gentle with smaller animals and with humans. They lived in the tent with the family, sharing bed and board. Descended from pariah-type dogs that had come with prehistoric migrations, the Tahltan Dogs were centralized in the remote mountainous areas of northwestern British Columbia and the Southern Yukon. Their usual diet was small bits of birds, meat and fish, and they flourished in the bitter cold. Outside their native environment, they succumbed to distemper, heat prostration and problems due to dietary changes. As white explorers came into the territory, bringing a variety of other dogs, the Tahltan Dog became diluted. <h3>Coat and colour</h3> A Tahltan Bear Dog was primarily black, dark brown or blue, with some white patches on the chest and sometimes the feet. Standing 14 to 17 inches high at the shoulder, with relatively large, erect pointed ears, with a refined, pointed muzzle.

During most periods of their history, the Kyrgyz have been a predominantly nomadic people, which has migrated through vast parts of Siberia and Central Asia. Therefore it is very unlikely that the origins of the Taigan can be traced back to one single ancestor. However, the Taigan in its present form is a pronounced mountain breed, perfectly adapted to its work in the alpine regions of the Tian Shan mountain range. In the 1930s, Soviet cynologists began to register the existing specimens in the Kyrgyz SSR, but this work had to be stopped after the German invasion of the USSR in 1941. In 1964, the USSR laid down the first standard for the breed. Different from many western countries, live coursing has always been legal in the Soviet Union; hunters were organised in kolkhozy and had to deliver certain amounts of fur to the collective farms. After Kyrgyzstan became independent in 1991, the role of the breed underwent a change. The collapse of the collective farms forced many people in the rural areas of Kyrgyzstan to return to the nomadic life of their ancestors. For some of them, hunting with the Taigan became again an occupation which helps them to earn their living. On the other hand, parts of the new urban upper class have discovered the Taigan as a prestigious symbol of national heritage during the past few years. In 1995, the<i>Cinologist Council of the Kyrgyz Republic</i> (a body connected with the Ministry of Agriculture) adopted a new breed standard, which was later approved by the hunting commission at the Ministry of Environmental Protection. A number of breed shows were held in Bishkek, but with only small attendance by hunters from the countryside. During a state visit to Norway in November 2003, the former Kyrgyz president Askar Akayev gave two Taigan puppies as a present to King Harald V and prime minister Kjell Magne Bondevik. This caused a smalldiplomatic turmoil, since the Norwegian import regulations require a quarantine of four months for dogs entering Norway from a non-European country, and neither the king nor the prime minister were willing to keep the dogs. To avoid hurting the feelings of the Kyrgyz delegation, the mayor of the city of Trondheim, Rita Ottervik, decided to take care of the two puppies, which were later given to experienced dog owners after they had passed quarantine.<sup id=""cite_ref-1""> </sup> Since 2005, a national kennel club exists in Kyrgyzstan, which has been admitted to the FCI as a contact partner in 2009. This would now enable Kyrgyzstan to apply for international recognition of the Taigan, provided that an application will be sent to the FCI breed standard commission.

There are no known references to the talbot as a breed of hound in Medieval French, and none have been found in English before the mid-16th century.</p> <p style=""text-align: left;"">In Medieval times, ""Talbot"" was a common name for an individual hound, so used before 1400 in Chaucer's <i>Nun's Priests Tale</i> (l 3383), and used as an example of a hound name in a 16th-century book of hunting.<sup id=""cite_ref-3""> </sup></p> <p style=""text-align: left;"">By the 17th century it clearly existed as a breed or type. Large, heavy, slow hounds were 'talbot-like', whatever their colour, though the 'milk white' was 'the true talbot'. William Somervile in his poem ""The Chase"", published 1735, describes the former use of ""lime-hounds"" (leashed hounds) on the Scottish Borders to catch thieves, obviously referring to the bloodhound and the sleuth hound, but adding that the (white) talbot was the ""prime"" example of this type of hound.</p> <p style=""text-align: left;"">The origin of both the name and the animal is uncertain. The Earls of Shrewsbury, whose family name is Talbot, have as their family crest a white, short-legged hound. In a quotation from about 1449, the king referred to John Talbot, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury as ""Talbott, oure good dogge"", perhaps as a play on his name, or in allusion to the family badge. In a MS in the British LibraryJohn Talbot is shown presenting a Book of Romances to Queen Margaret, with a white dog standing behind him, which serves, symbolically, to identify him. It is obviously a small hound, and it seems unlikely that it could have been used in this way if ""Talbot"" had been associated in the mind of the people of the time with a large animal.</p> <p style=""text-align: left;"">The talbot and the greyhound were, apparently, the only hounds used in heraldry, and it could be that the talbot originated as an emblematic or heraldic hound. References to this heraldic talbot seem to be earlier than any references to a real dog. The talbot figures in many Coats of Arms, for instance in later ones of the earls of Shrewsbury, in which two talbots appear as supporters.</p> <p style=""text-align: left;"">It is quite a plausible idea that from these beginnings the name ""talbot"" was extended to any large heavy white scent hound, and from there helped to establish a breed or type. It was certainly similar to the bloodhound (and ""white"" is given as one of the colours of the bloodhound around the 16th and 17th centuries) as regards size, and use as a leash-hound.<sup id=""cite_ref-Markham_4-1""> </sup></p> <p style=""text-align: left;"">As earliest references to this dog are much later than those to bloodhounds it cannot convincingly be regarded as an ancestor of the bloodhound.</p> <p style=""text-align: left;"">The talbot seems to have existed as a breed, a little distinct from the bloodhound, until the end of the 18th century, after which, like two other large breeds to which it may have been related, the Northern and the Southern Hound, it disappeared. Some early dog-shows apparently offered classes for talbots, but they were never entered, and so were dropped.</p> <p style=""text-align: left;""></p>",NULL,NULL,NULL,"Y","0"

The first litter was produced in 2002, but at the time of their birth the name 'Tamaskan' did not exist. The Tamaskan name was not chosen for the breed until later, in 2006. In 2006 the founders started the Tamaskan Dog Register to record all information about the Tamaskan and list all dogs bred. There are now many clubs, registers and societies branching off from this original TDR. This means that there is no longer a single source of information about the breed and the breeds records are scattered between these organisations. Breeds used to create the Tamaskan Dog include (but not limited to) Northern Inuit, Utonagan, Siberian Husky, Alaskan Malamute, German Shepherd, one Saarlooswolfhondand other arctic breeds including Finnish racing huskies (unregistered huskies and husky crosses bred for competitive sled racing in Lapland). &nbsp; <h2>Description</h2> Tamaskans are large, athletic dogs; slightly taller in size than German Shepherds. With regards to build, they are substantially larger than their Siberian Husky ancestors but smaller than the Alaskan Malamute. They generally resemble grey wolves. On average, Tamaskan adults measure around 24-28 inches (60?70 cm) tall at the shoulder and typically weigh between 55-88 pounds (25-40 kg)?the heaviest recorded Tamaskan males (to date) weigh just under 50 kg. Females are usually slightly smaller and lighter than males, with a distinct feminine appearance. Males are more heavyset with broader heads and a heavier bone structure. Tamaskans have a lupine appearance with a straight bushy tail and thick double coat that comes in three main colors: Wolf Gray, Red Gray, and Black Gray. Each individual guard hair is agouti banded along its length. The almond-shaped eyes range from yellow through to amber and brown, with lighter colored eyes being very rare. Blue eyes are not acceptable, nor are mismatched eyes. &nbsp; <h2>Temperament</h2> Tamaskans are intelligent and have been known to excel in agility, obedience and working trials. They also make decent sled dogs and many Tamaskan living in colder climates regularly participate in recreational, and occasionally competitive, dogsled racing as well asskijoring. They could make good search and rescue dogs due to their keen sense of smell, stamina and endurance. Tamaskans can also be successfully trained as therapy or assistance dogs due to their friendly and laid-back personality. As a breed they tend to be social and are good with people, children, and other dogs, as well as other family pets (cats, chickens, rabbits, hamsters, parakeets, etc.). However, some lines have produced shy dogs with high prey drives. Tamaskan dogs need company, and if left alone for long periods of time, they may become bored, which can lead to destructive behavior and/or escape attempts. Moreover, Tamaskan Dogs love to dig holes and can pull quite strongly on the leash; both traits they have inherited from their arctic heritage. However, unlike some of their husky ancestors, Tamaskans generally respond well off the leash and, with training, will return when called.

In the case of the Teddy Roosevelt Terrier, ""bench legged feist"".<sup id=""cite_ref-3""></sup><sup id=""cite_ref-5""><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teddy_Roosevelt_Terrier#cite_note-5""> </a></sup> Being the breed was primarily a farm and hunting dog it was common to see and hear of crossing Rat Terriers to other breeds. One such early cross was with the Beagle and it is very possible it is this cross that reinforced the bench leg since the Bench Legged Beagle was a common hunting companion.<sup id=""cite_ref-6""><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teddy_Roosevelt_Terrier#cite_note-6""> </a></sup> Separating the long legged phenotype from the short legged phenotype in most cases did not occur and it was very common to see litters born from parents of either or both phenotypes displaying a variety of leg and body length yet all were still considered and labeled merely as Rat Terriers. In wasn't until the middle 1990's that an effort to segregate the types began in earnest but mixing of the two types in some cases still exists today. When the types were separated by the Rat Terrier Club of America the short legged variety was named in honor of Theodore Roosevelt, although he never owned Rat Terriers nor was he instrumental in developing the Teddy Roosevelt Terrier. The dog most attributed to being one of the foundations for the Rat Terriers was a black and tan mixed bred feist type dog owned by the Roosevelt's. In one of his letters to his children President Roosevelt writes ""There is a very cunning little dog named Skip, belonging to John Goff's pack, who has completely adopted me. I think I shall take him home to Archie. He likes to ride on Dr. Lambert's horse, or mine, and though he is not as big as Jack, takes eager part in the fight with every bear and bobcat."" Often confused with Skip the black and tan feist, the Roosevelt's also had a dog named Scamp. Scamp is the only dog mentioned in Roosevelt's letters as ever hunting Rat's while in the White House, ""Scamp is really an extraordinary ratter and kills a great many rats in the White House, in the cellars and on the lower floor and among the machinery. He is really a very nice little dog.""Unfortunately there are no pictures of Scamp nor descriptions other than one which describes him as a Fox Terrier. Another Terrier which often is confused with the Rat Terrier was Roosevelt's dog named Jack. In Mr. Roosevelt's letter dated July 27, 1902 to Mrs. Roswell Field he writes, ""It is a real pleasure to send you a photograph of my boy Kermit, with Jack, the Manchester Terrier, who is absolutely a member of the family."" Indicating Jack was a Manchester Terrier, not a Rat Terrier. The first Standard for the breed was developed by the now defunct Teddy Roosevelt Terrier Club of America in 1996. There are currently several registration organizations all of which have their own standard but the most commonly accepted is the United Kennel Cluband the United Kennel Club International. Although the UKCI still only recognizes them as a variation of the Rat Terrier. In 1999 both ""Rat Terrier"" and ?Teddy Roosevelt Terrier"" were accepted as a separate breeds by the United Kennel Club.<sup id=""cite_ref-ukcdogs.com_9-1""><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teddy_Roosevelt_Terrier#cite_note-ukcdogs.com-9""> </a></sup> Currently, the UKC accepts Single Teddy Roosevelt Terrier Registration Applications for dogs from 10 different registries where they are simply designated as ""Rat Terriers."" &nbsp; <h2>Appearance</h2> The Teddy Roosevelt Terrier is a low-set, muscular, active, small-to-medium size hunting terrier. The preferred ratio of length of body (prosternum to point of buttocks) to height (withers to ground) is between 10:7 and 10:8. The head is broad, slightly domed, wedge-shaped, and proportionate to the size of the body. Ears are V-shaped, set at the outside edges of the skull, and may be erect or button. A docked tail is preferred, but a natural bob tail or a natural tail carried in an upward curve are also acceptable. The Teddy Roosevelt Terrier comes in solid white, other solid colors with markings, and white with a variety of colored patches. The Teddy Roosevelt Terrier should be evaluated as a working terrier, and exaggerations, or faults, should be penalized in proportion to how much they interfere with the dog?s ability to work. Honorable scars resulting from field work are not to be penaliz <h2>Characteristics</h2> Like the Rat Terrier, the Teddy Roosevelt Terrier of today is bred for versatility, including hunting instincts, soundness of health, great temperament, and good looks. The Teddy Roosevelt Terrier has a higher than average prey drive and will chase squirrels, rats, stray cats and any other animal they consider prey. They will also dig and follow mole trails leaving a vast array of trenches and holes behind. They make excellent watch dogs and can be very protective and territorial. Teddies share a love for their families and become very attached, craving human interaction and affection. Always by their owner's side, they will become a constant shadow, following their master around throughout the daily routine. Teddies are very smart and loyal, which makes them easy to train. They are energetic and playful, and their antics can make you laugh daily. However, when it?s time to settle down they are just as content to be in your lap. Teddies can adapt to pretty much any lifestyle, whether you show in conformation rings, work in agility trials, or just want a great companion for your home or farm. Their small to medium size makes them suitable to apartment living as well. Today, the Teddy Roosevelt Terrier is gaining a solid following and becoming a popular household companion.

These small, predominantly-white dogs were vermin killers, weathering the harsh climate. By the late 19th century a dog type known as the Miniature Fox Terrier (known colloquially as ""Mini Foxies"") was well established in rural Australia as a vermin killer and family companion. By the 1920s the dog was a fixture in urban households.<sup id=""cite_ref-thedogsite_3-0""> </sup> The name ""Tenterfield"" is sometimes incorrectly stated to denote the terrier?s place of origin as Tenterfield, New South Wales. Rather, Tenterfield is only one of many Australian towns and villages in which small dogs of this type were known to exist. The town of Tenterfield is significant in Australian history, and the best-known owner of its saddlery was a man named George Woolnough, who was immortalized by his grandson, entertainer Peter Allen, as the ""Tenterfield Saddler"". Mr. Woolnough owned a number of small dogs; however, photographs of these dogs are not available. The name Tenterfield Terrier was suggested in the 1990s by television gardening personality Don Burke, and was adopted by the South Australian Miniature Fox Terrier club. &nbsp; <h2>Appearance</h2> Whilst having a square or compact body, no feature of a Tenterfield's construction should be exaggerated. Hence Tenterfields should not have an elongated head like a Fox Terrier. Rather, the head is wedge shaped with equal length from occiput to stop and stop to the end of the nose. This gives the head parallel head planes, making the head unique in this Group. The Tenterfield Terrier can also have pricked or erect ears or semi-erect ears. Tenterfield Terriers stand around 28 cm (11 inches) high and can come in tan and white, black and white, liver/tan/white tri-coloured or black/tan/white tri-coloured.

In this district, near the Yom River, there is amonastery called Wat Bangkaew where it is believed that Thai Bangkaew Dogs originated. Legend has it that the third abbot of Bangkaew Temple, the respected Luang Puh Maak Metharee, was known for mercy and giving care to all living things. An old Bangkaew villager named Tah Nim gave the abbot a native bitch. Because she was pregnant without any dog in the area, her mating was thought to be either a jackal(<i>Canis aureus</i>) or a dhole (<i>Cuon alpinus</i>) living in the surrounding forest. A chromosome study of Thai Bangkaew dog confirmed that the breed is the result of domestic dog and jackal interbreed. The resulting litter produced longhaired puppies of black and dark brown coloration. Luang Puh Maak Metharee raised the resulting puppies, four females. Seasonal rain produced flooding, a natural barrier that limited the dogs contributing to the gene pool. Inbreeding that took place led to the creation of the Thai Bangkaew Dogs. From then on the breed has been selectively bred and has become one of the most favored varieties of Thai dogs. &nbsp; <h2>Appearance</h2> The Thai Bangkaew Dog is compactly built and square in profile. It is well proportioned, with a smooth gait. The double coat consists of a short undercoat, with longerguard hairs growing through it forming the outer coat. The coat is thicker and longer around the neck, chest, and back forming a lion-like ruff, which is more noticeable on male dogs than on female dogs. The plumed tail is carried with moderate upward curve over the back. The TBD comes in white with shades of red, gray, brown, and black in a wide variety of patterns.

The history of the breed is the subject of numerous hypotheses. The other existing purebreeds of ridgeback dog are the Rhodesian Ridgeback from Africa and the Phu Quoc Ridgeback from Vietnam, which is somewhat smaller than the Thai Ridgeback. Based on genetic-based hypothesis, both Thai Ridgeback Dog and Phu Quoc Dog are likely to be descended from Funan Ridgeback Dog which originated over 1,000 years ago in Funan Era of the region. The Hottentot Dog or Ari Dog (as called by the tribe), a known African ridgeback ancestor of the Rhodesian Ridgeback, is now extinct. Its link to the Funan Ridgeback Dog is very likely in a historian opinion. The possible genetic connection among the three remaining breeds is being investigated through DNA studies. The relationship between the Thai Ridgeback and the Rhodesian Ridgeback is uncertain, but possible through the Hottentot Dog or Ari Dog. There is minimal scientific proof that they are related<sup id=""cite_ref-5""> </sup> &nbsp; <h3>Temperament</h3> Thai Ridgebacks are an intelligent breed. The energy level is typically medium to high, with most of the day spent lounging and activity periods occurring in sporadic bursts. Well bred and properly socialized Thai Ridgebacks make loyal, loving family pets. They are naturally protective of their home and family and can be aggressive or shy when not properly socialized. They are best kept by consistent owners who have a thorough understanding of dog behavior. Because of prior geographic isolation and lack of human contact, the Thai Ridgeback remains independent minded and much of the original natural instinct and drives remain intact, particularly prey drive. Due to its nature, the Thai Ridgeback is not recommended for the novice dog handler. They have an excellent jumping ability and may seek to roam if not properly contained. <sup id=""cite_ref-3""> </sup> <h2>Health</h2> Thai ridgebacks are a hardy, overall healthy breed with few inherent health issues. The breed has reproduced in Thailand almost exclusively by natural selection until the very recent past. The domesticated population is small. Inbreeding depression has not been observed in the breed. Thai Ridgeback Dogs are prone to dermoid sinus. Modern lines of Thai Ridgeback, resulting from interpopulation crosses, may also be prone to hip dysplasia and other genetic disorders.

It has been theorized that an early Tibetan dog is the ancestor to all Molossus breeds, although this is disputed by most experts. A highly questionable study at Nanjing Agricultural University's Laboratory of Animal Reproductive Genetics and Molecular Evolution in Nanjing, China, found that while most common dog breeds genetically diverged from the wolf approximately 42,000 years ago, the Tibetan Mastiff genetically diverged from the wolf approximately 58,000 years ago.<sup id=""cite_ref-5""> </sup> In the early 19th century, King George IV owned a pair of Tibetan Mastiffs, and enough of the breed were available in England in 1906 to be shown at the 1906 Crystal Palace show. However, during the war years, the breed lost favor and focus and nearly died out in England. After 1980, the breed began to gain in popularity worldwide. Although the breed is still considered somewhat uncommon, as more active breeders arose and produced adequate numbers of dogs, various registries and show organizations (FCI, AKC) began to recognize the breed. Since AKC recognition, the number of active breeders has skyrocketed, leading to over-production of puppies, many of which are highly inbred and of questionable quality. Initially, the breed suffered because of the limited gene pool from the original stock, but today's reputable breeders work hard at reducing the genetic problems through selective breeding and the international exchange of new bloodlines. However, some few breeders cling to the practice of inbreeding, do not perform health tests on their breeding stock, and do not support buyers of the puppies they produce. Many puppies and adult dogs end up in shelters and in rescue situations. In 2008, the Tibetan Mastiff competed for the first time in the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show. A Chinese woman was reported to have spent more than 4 million yuan to buy an 18-month-old purebred male Tibetan Mastiff, which she named Yangtze No. 2. In March 2011, a red Tibetan mastiff was reported to have been sold to a 'coal baron' from northern China for 10 million yuan. There have been other similar reports of dogs sold for astronomical prices; however, most of these appear to be breeders' attempts to drive up the prices of their dogs. Photos of dogs shown on web sites are frequently photoshopped to exaggerate color intensity, size, and ""bone"". Buyers have reported getting their dogs home only to find that bathing removes both color and ""hair extensions"" from the coat. <h3>Appearance</h3> <div></div> Some breeders differentiate between two ""types"" of Tibetan Mastiff, the <i>Do-khyi</i> and the Tsang<i>-khyi</i>. The Tsang<i>-khyi</i> (which, to a Tibetan, means only ""dog from Tsang"") is also referred to as the ""monastery"" type, described as generally taller, heavier, and more heavily boned, with more facial wrinkling and haw than the <i>Do-khyi</i> or ""nomad"" type. Both types are often produced in the same litter with the larger, heavier pups being more rare. Males can reach heights up to 4 feet. Dogs bred in the West weigh between 150-200 lbs ?although dogs in the upper range are often overweight. The enormous dogs being produced in some Western and some Chinese kennels would have ""cost"" too much to keep fed to have been useful to nomads; and their questionable structure would have made them less useful as livestock or property guardians. The Tibetan Mastiff is considered a primitive breed. It typically retains the hardiness which would be required for it to survive in Tibet and the high-altitude Himalayan range, including the northern part of Nepal, India and Bhutan. Instinctive behaviors including canine pack behavior contributed to the survival of the breed in harsh environments. It is one of the few primitive dog breeds that retains a single estrus per year instead of two, even at much lower altitudes and in much more temperate climates than its native climate. This characteristic is also found in wild canids such as the wolf. Since its estrus usually takes place during late fall, most Tibetan Mastiff puppies are born between December and January.<sup id=""cite_ref-3""> </sup> Its double coat is long, subject to climate, and found in a wide variety of colors, including solid black, black and tan, various shades of ""red"" (from pale gold to deep red) and bluish-gray (dilute black), often with white markings. The coat of a Tibetan Mastiff lacks the unpleasant ""big-dog"" smell that affects many large breeds. The coat, whatever its length or color(s), should shed dirt and odors. Although the dogs shed somewhat throughout the year, there is generally one great ""molt"" in late winter or early spring and sometimes another, lesser molt in the late summer or early fall. (Sterilization of the dog may dramatically affect the coat as to texture, density, and shedding pattern.) Tibetan Mastiffs are shown under one standard in the West, but separated by the Indian breed standard into two varieties: Lion Head (smaller; exceptionally long hair from forehead to withers, creating a ruff or mane) and Tiger Head (larger; shorter hair).

Other, more closely inbred lines, produce short-lived, unhealthy dogs. The breed has fewer genetic health problems than many breeds, but cases can be found of hypothyroidism, entropion, ectropion, skin problems including allergies, autoimmune problems including demodex, missing teeth, malocclusion (overbite, underbite, wry mouth), cardiac problems, seizures, epilepsy, progressive retinal atrophy(PRA), cataract, and small ear canals with a tendency for infection. As with most large breeds, some will suffer with elbow or hip dysplasia. Canine inherited demyelinative neuropathy (CIDN), an inherited condition, appeared in one of the prominent lines of Tibetan Mastiffs in the early 1980s. Unfortunately, known carriers were bred extensively and are behind many lines still being actively bred. Because the mode of inheritance appears to be as a simple recessive, continued inbreeding can still produce affected puppies. Hypothyroidism is fairly common in Tibetan Mastiffs, as it is in many large ""northern"" breeds. They should be tested periodically throughout their lives using a complete thyroid ""panel"". (Simple T2/T4 testing is virtually useless.) However, because the standard thyroid levels were established using domestic dog breeds, test results must be considered in the context of what is ""normal"" for the breed, not what is normal across all breeds. Many dogs of this breed will have ""low"" thyroid values but no clinical symptoms. Vets and owners differ on the relative merits of medicating dogs which test ""low"", but are completely asymptomatic. Some researchers think that asymptomatic hypothyroidism may have been adaptive in the regions of origin for many breeds, since less nutrition is required for the dog to stay in good condition. Therefore, attempts to eliminate ""low thyroid"" dogs from the Tibetan Mastiff gene pool may have unintended consequences for the breed. &nbsp; <h3>Temperament</h3> As a flock guardian dog in Tibet and in the West, it is capable of confronting predators the size of wolves and leopards, although it uses all the usual livestock guardian tactics (e.g., barking, scent-marking perimeters) to warn them away and avoid direct confrontations. As a socialized, more domestic dog, it can thrive in a spacious, fenced yard with a canine companion, but it is generally not an appropriate dog for apartment living. The Western-bred dogs are generally more easy-going, although somewhat aloof with strangers coming to the home. Through hundreds of years of selective breeding for a protective flock and family guardian, the breed has been prized for being a nocturnal sentry, keeping would-be predators and intruders at bay, barking at sounds throughout the night. Leaving a Tibetan Mastiff outside all night with neighbors nearby is not recommended. They often sleep during the day to be more active, alert and aware at night. Like all flock guardian breeds, they are intelligent and stubborn to a fault, so obedience training is recommended (although only mildly successful with some individuals) since this is a strong-willed, powerful breed. Unless they are to be used exclusively as livestock guardians, socialization is also critical with this breed because of their reserved nature with strangers and guardian instincts. They are excellent family dogs?for the right family. Owners must understand canine psychology and be willing and able to assume the primary leadership position. Lack of consistent, rational discipline can result in the creation of dangerous, unpredictable dogs (although this is true of virtually every dog breed). The protectiveness of Tibetan Mastiffs requires alertness and planning by the owner in order to avoid mishaps when the dog is simply performing as a guardian. The breed is not recommended for novice dog owners.

The practice of sending the dogs as gifts to the palaces of China and other Buddhist countries grew significantly, and more ""lion dogs"" were presented back toTibet, continuing until as late as 1908. As a result of exchanges of Tibetan Spaniels between palaces and monasteries, the breed is likely to have common ancestors with Oriental breeds such as the Japanese Chin and the Pekingese. Not only was the Tibetan Spaniel prized as a pet and companion, it was a useful member of Tibetan monastic life. The little dogs would sit on the monastery walls, keeping watch over the countryside. Their keen eyesight and ability to see great distances made them excellent watchdogs. They would alarm bark to alert the monks and the Tibetan Mastiffs below. In addition to functioning as lookouts, the Tibetan Spaniels were trained to spin the monk's prayer wheels. They also slept with the monks at night to provide warmth.<sup id=""cite_ref-6""> </sup> Village-bred Tibetan Spaniels varied greatly in size and type, and the smaller puppies were usually given as gifts to the monasteries. In turn, these smaller dogs used in the monastery breeding programs were probably combined with the more elegant Tibetan Spaniel-type dogs brought from China. Those bred closer to the Chinese borders were characterized by shorter muzzles. &nbsp; <h3>Temperament</h3> Extremely intelligent, the Tibetan Spaniel is one of the most cat-like dog breeds. Their favorite pastime is looking out the window at the world. They will climb on the sofa, table, dresser, etc., to see what is going on outside. At the same time, they are highly affectionate and will often greet their owners by jumping into their lap and licking their face.<sup id=""cite_ref-4""> </sup> Tibetan Spaniels are a social breed that needs regular contact with their humans. They do not respond well to being left alone for long periods of time. Having been developed as a companion dog by Tibetan monks they are emotional and empathetic to the needs of their owners. It is important to socialize Tibbies at an early age to a variety of people and situations. They are protective of their family. Even after socialization, they are typically aloof with strangers. If startled or uneasy, a Tibbie will express their distrust with loud alarm barking. While utterly devoted to their family members, Tibbies are fiercely independent with a tendency to wander off and explore rather than come when called. This quality - assertive, independent, and alert - is the standard temperament required by both the AKC and FCI breed standards.<sup id=""cite_ref-5""> </sup> [button link=""http://alphamatch.com/listing-type/pets/?pet-type=1081&amp;breed-2=1035"" color=""black"" type=""big-button"" type=""Search for Tibetan Spaniel""]Search for Tibetan Spaniel[/button] &nbsp; <h3>Appearance</h3> The Tibetan Spaniel has a domed head that is small, in comparison to the body. It has a short blunt muzzle free of wrinkles. Teeth meet in an undershot or level bite. The nose is black. The eyes are medium but in keeping with the face and are set wide apart, these are oval in shape. The Tibetan Spaniel does not have extra skin around the eyes; this helps to tell the breed apart from the Pekingese. The ears hang down either side of the head to cheek level and are feathered with a v shape. The neck is covered in a mane of hair, which is more noticeable in the male of the breed. The Tibetan Spaniel's front legs are a little bowed and the feet are ""hare-like"". This dog has a great feathered tail that is set high and is carried over their back. The coat is a silky double coat lying flat and is short and smooth on the face and leg fronts; it is medium in length on the body; it has feathering on the ears, toes and tail. Tibetan Spaniels come in all colours and be solid, shaded and multi-coloured. Colours that are seen are red, fawn, gold, white, cream, black and tan, and parti. Often there are white markings on the feet. By AKC breed standard, this breed grows to about 10 in (25 cm) at the shoulder, and the weight is 9?15 lb (4.1?6.8 kg). Slightly larger Tibetan Spaniels can often be found outside the show ring. &nbsp; <h2>Health</h2> The Tibetan Spaniel is a generally healthy dog with a life expectancy of 13?16 years. Progressive retinal atrophy is a genetic disease that can occur in the breed. The disease is an inherited form of blindness in dogs that has in two forms: generalized PRA and central PRA.

Monks and families referred to the ancient breed as ""the little people"", for they were highly valued as companions who were eager to assist in protecting properties and flocks. Since the dog was considered a bringer of luck, mistreating or selling a Tibetan Terrier was believed to cause bad luck to both family and village. The first Tibetan Terrier to come to Europe came with Dr. A.R.H. Greig of England in 1922. She was given a gold and white female puppy ""Bunti"" for successfully performing an operation on a patient. After acquiring a second male ""Rajah"", Dr. Greig established a kennel and began to breed them. The first litter was born in 1924, registered as Lhasa Terriers. In 1930, the Kennel Club of India changed the breed's name to Tibetan Terrier. The first Tibetan Terriers in the USA were imported in 1956 by Dr. Henry and Mrs. Alice Murphy of Great Falls, Virginia. In 1973, the breed was recognized by the American Kennel Club and was classified into the non-sporting group.<sup id=""cite_ref-AKC_1-1""> </sup> Tibetan Terriers are related to and have contributed to the development of other Tibetan breeds, including the Shih Tzu, Lhasa Apso, and theTibetan Spaniel.<sup id=""cite_ref-DBIC_4-1""> </sup> &nbsp; <h3>Appearance</h3> The Tibetan Terrier is a powerful, medium sized dog of square proportions, with a shaggy coat. They vary widely in height and weight,<sup id=""cite_ref-7"">[7]</sup>ranging from 14-16 in (35?41 cm) and is 18-30 lb (8?14 kg), with 20-24 lb (9.5?11 kg) preferred for either sex. All weights are acceptable if in proportion to the size. Fully grown, the Tibetan Terrier resembles a miniaturized Old English Sheepdog. The head is moderate, with a strong muzzle of medium length, and a skull neither rounded nor flat. The eyes are large, dark, and set fairly far apart. The V-shaped drop ears are well feathered, and should be set high on the sides of the skull. Although the preferred colour for the nose is black, in showdogs, they are also sometimes brown. The body is well muscled and compact. The length of the back should be equal to the height at the withers, giving the breed its typical square look. The tail is set high, well feathered, and carried in a curl over the back. One of the more unusual features of the Tibetan Terrier is the broad, flat feet with hair between the toes. They are ideal for climbing mountains and act as natural snow shoes.

They are amiable and affectionate family dogs, sensitive to their owners and gentle with older children if properly introduced. As is fitting for a dog formerly used as a watch dog, they tend to be reserved around strangers, but should never be aggressive nor shy with them. Though not prone to excessive barking, the Tibetan Terrier has an assertive bark. Suitable for apartment living, the Tibetan is still an energetic and surprisingly strong dog, and needs regular exercise. The energy level of the Tibetan is moderate to high and its general nature is happy, active, lively, intelligent and agile. As a result, they are well suited for dog sports such as agility. They are steadfast, determined, and clever, which can lead to them being stubborn. Tibetan Terriers are usually charming and loyal. Some dogs of this breed can often be jealous, which can make it hard to live with another pet. &nbsp; <h2>Health</h2> A UK Kennel Club survey puts the average lifespan of the breed at 12 years. About one in five lives to 15 years or more, with the longest-lived Tibetan terrier having lived to 18.25 years.<sup id=""cite_ref-11""> </sup> Though an athletic breed that has been bred for a natural look, the Tibetan terrier is still susceptible to a variety of health problems, especially those related to the eyes and joints. These health problems can include canine hip dysplasia, luxating patella, progressive retinal atrophy, lens luxation, cataracts and heart murmurs. Tibetans also have a history of being somewhat allergic to dairy, wheat and grains. Because of these potential health conditions Tibetan terrier clubs recommend purchasing from breeders who participate in eye and hip testing, such as the Canine Eye Registration Foundation (CERF) and Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA). In addition, Tibetan Terriers can carry the genetic disease canine neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, called Batten disease in humans. Research is on-going to find the gene(s) responsible for this progressive disease in both Tibetan terriers and humans. A DNA test has been developed to identify this gene in several breeds of dog, including the Tibetan terrier.

The Tornjak is one of the very old breeds from ancient times, and it was mentioned in handwritten papers for the first time in the 9th century, in the documents of the Catholic Church. The breed was later mentioned in the 11th and 14th century. Description of Tornjak's from these documents are the very same as they are today, except for the name of the breed, which was <i>Bosanski Ov?ar</i>, meaning Bosnian Shepherd Dog. It was also called the<i>Hrvatski pas planinac</i>, meaning Croatian mountain dog. The dogs in these documents were described entirely equal (in respect to their function and their appearance) as they are today: a protective guarding dog which keeps and watches all what their owners ask from them, but highly intelligent and selectively bred to be without excessive aggression. They are also pleasant against strangers that they meet outside of their domain. It is considered that the dogs of the Tornjak's type have existed in the area around and in Dinarides (Dinaric Alps), especially in the region around Vla?i? (close to the city of Travnik, Bosnia and Herzegovina) as a central area of the region since the Roman times. The Romans used their dogs for war and as guardian dogs, as well as for fighting in the arena. Although the Tornjak is a very old breed, with the vanishing of nomadic sheep herding the Tornjak also gradually vanished. In the early 1970s, a group of local cynologists began to collect the remaining dogs which best corresponded to the old writings about the breed.<sup id=""cite_ref-123dog.net_2-1""> </sup> The first written traces about the existence of Tornjak dogs date back to the 9th century. Descriptions about the Tornjak were found in the writings of Peter Horvat, bishop of ?akovo, Croatia, which date back to the year 1374, those descriptions were also found in the writings of Peter Luki?, Canon of the ?akovo diocese, which were written in 1752. The term 'Tornjak' evolved from the Bosnian/Croatian word ""tor"", which means an enclosed area where the sheep live in. To this day, these dogs are called <i>Tora?i</i> (Torashi) in the surroundings of the city of Sinj and on theKame?nica mountain, whereas the shepherds of the Dinara-mountains call them <i>Dinarci</i>. It is theorized (although not proven) that the Tornjak, as with other Livestock guardian dog breeds, are descended from the dogs that were developed somewhere around 9000 years ago inMesopotamia following the domestication of sheep and goats in the same area.<sup id=""cite_ref-123dog.net_2-2""> </sup> &nbsp; <h2>Temperament</h2> Tornjak has a calm temperament. A typical adult Tornjak is very calm, peaceful, at first sight an indifferent animal, but when the situation demands it, it is a vigilant and very alert watchdog. The character of Tornjak is equal to the temperament, they are not nervous and not aggressive in general, they are very tough not too demanding sturdy dogs. With their human family they are very emotional. When the Tornjak live in a pack they are highly social animals and there isn't any fighting between the pack members. Towards strangers or other animals, as a rule, Tornjak is not overly aggressive. But when the situation calls upon it, Tornjak is quite decisive and it can without any consideration attack even much stronger rivals. Shepherds used to say that a Tornjak who guards the flock is a fair match to two wolves, and a couple will confront and chase away a bear without any undue respect. In these situations Tornjaks are very tenacious. &nbsp; <h2>Appearance</h2> Tornjaks are large and powerful dogs, with well proportioned, almost square-bodied features and agile movements. The dog's bones are not light, but nevertheless not heavy nor coarse. They have long and thick double coat with a thick undercoat. The bodies of these dogs are strong and well built, with harmonious and dignified movements. The dogs have long and thick hair and this adequately protects them against poor weather conditions. The dogs typically possess shaggy tails, kept high like a flag. Tornjaks have a clear, self-confident, serious and calm disposition. In general the Tornjak is a long coated dog with short hair over the face and legs. The topcoat is long, thick, coarse and straight. It is especially long on the upper part of the croup, over the shoulders and the back it can be slightly wavy. On the muzzle and the forehead, up to the imaginary line connecting the ears, over the ears and on the front parts of legs and feet it is short. It is especially abundant around the neck (mane), dense and long over the upper thighs (breeches). It forms feathers along the forearms. With well coated dogs it is also especially abundant on the rear of hind pasterns. Tornjaks can be either solid colored or parti-colored, usually the color white predominates. The color of Tornjaks is unrestricted, all colors are accepted. It ranges from nearly completely white to almost black with yellow, red, brown and not-quite-desired gray in between. There are two main types: piebald and Irish spotting. Originally, it was made a goal to breed varying colors and patterns so shepherds could distinguish their dogs easily from a distance. Breeders also strife towards distinction compared to other breeds.

They make a splendid companion dog for an owner who understands the characteristics of the breed and is willing to work with their in-bred nature as a hunting dog. On the scent, they are tireless, alert, and intense. At home; they are mellow, sensitive lovers of comfort. They like having their own kennel or other space into which they can retreat at will, if provided with pillows and blankets, as they love to nest. Owners have noted that ""getting a Walker hound out of a bed, off a couch or away from a fireplace will be a feat in itself."" Treeing Walker Coonhounds get along exceptionally well with other dogs and with children. Like most hounds, they are even-tempered and difficult to annoy or drive into aggression towards people or fellow dogs. With careful introduction, they will even live in happy harmony with the family cat, despite their nature as a small-game hunter. They are very energetic when young, and some people can be alarmed by their tendency to stand up on their hind legs to pursue their curiosity or to bark urgently out of a desire to meet a new dog. This breed is highly intelligent, and consequently they require absolute consistency of training, as they look for loopholes to exploit. They may attempt to negotiate, responding to human direction by offering an alternative course of action they prefer. They are close observers of human behavior and learn to respond to subtle gestures and a large number of words, though not always in a manner that the human might desire or predict. Their intelligence is thus sometimes underestimated or misunderstood. Because they enjoy interacting with people, teaching them commands and tricks will help prevent the boredom that leads to bad behavior. They have been known to use objects as tools or to manipulate their environment to accomplish a task (e.g., moving furniture to climb over gates, using household objects to manipulate kennel mechanisms, etc.). They prefer complicated toys to simple chew-toys. They are most engaged by toys meant to be taken apart or stuffed with smaller toys, a toy that makes a variety of sounds, or toys with a hard-to-obtain treat inside.

It is most well known for being involved in the early development of the modern Curly Coated Retriever and Golden Retriever breeds of dog. They were described as a generally brown athletic dog from the area around Berwick-upon-Tweed near the River Tweed and close to the Scottish Borders. A type of water dog, the breed was not well known outside the local area. This breed may have been created by crossing local water dogs with imported St. John's water dog, another breed of dog which is also now extinct.The village of Norham, Northumberland, just south of the River Tweed was noted as being ""long famous"" for a breed of Water Spaniel of which were ""invariably brown"".<sup id=""cite_ref-2""> </sup> In 1816, Richard Lawrence wrote of the origins of the Tweed Water Spaniel ""Along rocky shores and dreadful declivities beyond the junction of the Tweed with the sea of Berwick, water dogs have derived an addition of strength, from the introduction of a cross with the Newfoundlanddog, which has rendered them completely adequate to the arduous difficulties and diurnal perils in which they are systematically engaged."" Although the quote refers specifically to the Newfoundland breed, it is actually more likely that it means the now extinct breed of the St. John's water dog which was sometimes referred to by its homeland's location of Newfoundland and Labrador.<sup id=""cite_ref-early_4-0""></sup><sup id=""cite_ref-ducks_5-0""> </sup> Stanley O'Neil, an expert in Flat-Coated Retrievers wrote of the Tweed Water Spaniel in a letter during the late 19th century, ""Further up the coast, probably Alnmouth, I saw men netting for salmon. With them was a dog with a wavy or curly coat. It was a tawny colour but, wet and spumy, it was difficult to see the exact colour, or how much was due to bleach and salt. Whilst my elders discussed the fishing I asked these Northumberland salmon net men whether their dog was a Water-Dog or a Curly, airing my knowledge. They told me he was a Tweed Water Spaniel. This was a new one on me. I had a nasty suspicion my leg was being pulled. This dog looked like a brown Water Dog to me, certainly retrieverish, and not at all spanielly. I asked if he came from a trawler, and was told it came from Berwick.""<sup id=""cite_ref-early_4-1""> </sup> Linda P. Case, of the University of Illinois, speculated that the Tweed Water Spaniel was so named because it was developed on the estate of Lord Tweedmouth, and in fact was simply the original name for a breed of dog that later became the Golden Retriever. However this theory is against the documented evidence, as the early development of the Golden Retriever was fully documented and listed the three Tweed Water Spaniels involved specifically by breed.<sup id=""cite_ref-cunliffe_7-0""> </sup> <h2>Appearance and temperament</h2> The Tweed Water Spaniel had a long tail and a curly, liver-colored coat, and looked similar to the Irish Water Spaniel except that it had a heavier muzzle and a pointed skull.

Their size was that of a small retriever, with a liver coloured curly coat. Instances of offspring which were liver coloured but tan below the knees were noted in Hugh Dalziel's 1897 work <i>British Dogs: Their Varieties, History, Characteristics, Breeding, Management, And Exhibition</i>, although the author speculated that this may have been due to Bloodhound ancestry in one of the parents of the litters.<sup id=""cite_ref-britishdogs150_10-0""> </sup> The breed was known for its intelligence, courage and sporting ability.<sup id=""cite_ref-101adorable_11-0""> </sup> &nbsp;",NULL,NULL,NULL,"Y","0"

The ancestors of the present Vizsla were the trusted and favorite hunting dogs of the Magyar tribes who lived in the Carpathian Basin in the 10th century. Primitive stone etchings over a thousand years old show the Magyar hunter with his falcon and his Vizsla. Companion dogs of the early warlords and barons, Vizsla blood was preserved pure for centuries by the land-owning aristocracy who guarded them jealously and continued to develop the hunting ability of these ""yellow-pointers"". Records of letters and writings show the high esteem in which the Vizsla was held. The Vizsla survived the Turkish occupation (1526?1696), the Hungarian Revolution (1848?49), World War I, World War II and the Soviet Period. However, Vizslas faced and survived several near-extinctions in their history, including being overrun by English Pointers and German Shorthair Pointers in the 1800s (Boggs, 2000:19) and again to near-extinction after World War II. A careful search of Hungary and a poll of Hungarian sportsmen revealed only about a dozen Vizslas of the true type still alive in the country. From that minimum stock, the breed rose to prominence once again. The various ""strains"" of the Vizsla have become somewhat distinctive as individuals bred stock that suited their hunting style. Outside Hungary, vizslas are commonly bred in Romania, Austria, Slovakia, and Serbia. The Vizsla started arriving in the United States at the close of World War II. As interest in and devotion to the breed began to increase, owners formed the Vizsla Club of America in order to gain AKC recognition. As a result of registering foundation stock with the AKC, Vizsla owners were able to obtain official recognition on November 25, 1960, as the Vizsla became the 115th breed recognized by the American Kennel Club.<sup id=""cite_ref-vca_1-1""> </sup> The Vizsla was used in development of other breeds, most notably the Weimaraner, Wire-haired Vizsla and German Shorthair Pointerbreeds. There is much conjecture about those same breeds, along with other pointer breeds, being used to reestablish the Vizsla breed at the end of 19th century.<sup id=""cite_ref-boggs_11-3""> </sup> <h3>Temperament</h3> Vizslas are very high energy, gentle-mannered, loyal, caring, and highly affectionate. They quickly form close bonds with their owners, children and even strangers. Often they are referred to as ""velcro"" dogs because of their loyalty and affection. Whenever these dogs feel neglected, want something or they aren't happy with doing something they will cry or whine. Some will bark at strangers if they feel that they are invading the ""pack"" space. They are very good guard dogs when trained. They are natural hunters with an excellent ability to take training. Not only are they great pointers, but they are excellent retrievers as well. They will retrieve on land and in the water, making the most of their natural instincts. However, they must be trained gently and without harsh commands or strong physical correction, as they have sensitive temperaments and can be easily damaged if trained too harshly. However the owner must show quiet authority in training, otherwise the dog is likely to take over the training session. Vizslas are excellent swimmers. Some may need a little motivation to get in the water but as they get used to it they will love it. Like all hunting dogs, Vizslas require a great deal of exercise to remain healthy and happy. The Vizsla thrives on attention, exercise, and interaction. With proper socialization and training, Vizslas are very gentle dogs that are great around children. The Vizsla wants to be close to its owner as much as possible. Many Vizslas will sleep in bed with their owners and, if allowed, burrow under the covers. Vizslas have been compared to horses in their tendency to ""trot"" rather than run and some ""wiggle"" their backsides as they walk.

Robust but rather lightly built, they are lean dogs, have defined muscles, and are observed to share similar physical characteristics with the Weimaraner. Various breeds are often mistaken for Vizslas, and Vizslas are often mistaken for other breeds. Redbone Coonhounds, Weimaraners andRhodesian Ridgebacks are some of the most commonly confused breeds. The body structure of a Vizsla is very similar in appearance to a Weimaraner and a Redbone Coonhound, though the Vizsla is typically leaner with a more defined musculature. Weimaraners and Rhodesian Ridgebacks are larger than Vizslas. The nose of the Vizsla will always have a reddish color that blends with the coat color. Black, brown, light pink, or another color nose is an indication of another breed. A Vizsla's eye and nail color should also blend with the coat color.<sup id=""cite_ref-3""> </sup> <h2>Health</h2> A Vizsla Club of America survey puts the average lifespan of the Vizsla at 9.15 years. The Vizsla is considered to be a robust dog, but some localized breeding programs using a small number of dogs have led to heritable illnesses in some offspring, including: <ul> <li>Hip dysplasia is very rare but remotely possible.<sup id=""cite_ref-8""> </sup></li> <li>Canine Epilepsy</li> <li>Cancer (Lipoma, Mast Cell Tumors, Hemangiosarcoma, Lymphoma)</li> <li>Sebaceous adenitis</li> </ul> Responsible breeders do not select dogs for breeding if they have such inherent problems.

Vizslas can also be prone to skin and food allergies.<sup id=""cite_ref-Dogster_10-0""> </sup> Unlike many other dogs, Vizslas do not have an undercoat.

Specimens from this group have been found preserved in European peat bogs which anthropologists trace to 4000 BC. The remains?with curly tails, foxy heads, and small erect ears?have been found dating back over 5,000 years. These little pets wore decorative ivory bracelets and collars. Engravings of similar dogs were found in Greece, and these have been determined to date to about 400 BC. The Volpino has been known and loved by Italian royalty for centuries, being a special favorite of the ladies. Although bearing a strong resemblance to the Pomeranian, the breed is much older and thus has a different background. The northern dogs found their way south very early in the history of domesticated dogs. The Keeshond is called a <i>Lupino</i> or a <i>Volpino</i> in Italian, meaning respectively <i>wolfy</i> and <i>foxy</i> (dog is understood). Despite his long history, the Volpino is unknown outside of Italy and is now quite rare even in his homeland. Despite its small size, this dog was originally kept as a guard dog. Its job was to alert the large mastiffs to an intruder. However, due to their lovely temperament and intelligence they also became popular as pets. For unknown reasons the breed's popularity dropped and in 1965 the last dogs were registered. In 1984 an attempt was made to revive the breed. The dogs still living as guard dogs on farms became the new breeding stock. Volpinos remain rare with about 2000 dogs world wide. Most are in Italy but some people are now breeding them in Scandinavia, the UK and the USA. A 2006 survey of kennel clubs found an average of 120 puppies registered each year in Italy (with ENCI) and a total of 200-300 registered each in Sweden, Norway and Finland. <h2>Health</h2> The basic well being and health of the Volpino Italiano breed is far better than with most dogs. However they are not immune to genetic and other diseases. At this point in time (Mid 2013) The greatest threat facing this race is the genetic mutation of the eye lens called Primary Lens Luxation (PLL). This is an extrememly painful disease that manifests itself when the Zonal cords holding the lens in place 'weakens' and breaks' at a genetically pre determined time (usually about 4 to 8 years old. Once the Zonal cords breaks the lens begins to move in to the interior of the eye increasing the pressure in the eye and causing the animal great pain. Because of the expense in removing the lens or the eyes the animal is usually euthanized.

One theory is that the ancestor is the St. Hubert Hound (also known as the Bloodhound and Sleuth Hound). Though these dogs are black, they can produce a grey dog when bred. Like the Vizsla at the time, the breed was created exclusively for the nobility and alike. The aim was to create a noble-looking, reliable gundog. As ownership was restricted and natural instinct, the breed was highly prized and lived with the family. This was unusual, as during this period, hunting dogs were kept in kennels in packs. This has resulted in a dog that needs to be near humans and that quickly deteriorates when kenneled. The Weimaraner was an all purpose family dog, capable of guarding the home, hunting with the family, and of course, being loving and loyal towards children. Originally, Germany was possessive of its skilled all-purpose gundog. Some of the earliest weimaraners, prior to being sent to America for breeding, were sterilized in order for America not to popularize their special breed. But starting in the late 19th century the breed became increasingly common throughout Europe and the United States. Although slower than many other gundogs, such as Pointers, the Weimaraner is thorough and this made it a welcome addition to the sportsman's household. The breed's happy, lively temperament has endeared it to families. With the rise in popularity, some changes have been made to the breed. Both in Britain and America (where the breed remains popular) breeders have taken care to breed to a standard. &nbsp; <h3>Appearance</h3> The Weimaraner is athletic in appearance. Traditionally, the tail is docked. In countries where this is still carried out, the docked tail should measure approximately 6 inches in the adult dog, and this is part of the American Kennel Club breed standard. Tail docking is illegal in several countries, and in these countries the breed is shown with an entire tail. The British Kennel Club breed standard describes a tail reaching to the hocks and carried below the level of back when relaxed, and the German breed club standard calls for a full tail that is strong and well coated, which can be carried above the line of the back when the dog is working. Weimaraners are great water dogs as evidenced by their webbed toes. The eyes of the Weimaraner may be light amber, grey, or blue-grey.

No walk is too far, and they will appreciate games and play in addition. An active owner is more likely to provide the vigorous exercising, games, or running that this breed requires. Weimaraners are high-energy and often wear out their owners, requiring appropriate training to learn how to calm them and to help them learn to control their behavior. Owners need patience and consistent, firm yet kind training, as this breed is particularly rambunctious during the first year and a half of its life. But, even after that year and a half of a rambunctious puppyhood, they still remain hyper as ever, even when they are settling into old age. Like many breeds, untrained and unconfined young dogs often create their own fun when left alone, such as chewing house quarters and furniture. Thus, many that are abandoned have behavioral issues as a result of isolation and inadequate exercise. Weimaraners are generally good with children, but may not be appropriate for smaller children due to their tendency to knock them down in the course of play. They also may knock over elderly people or children by accident. Early training to sit through positive reinforcement is critical to prevent jumping in the future. The Weimaraner is a hunting dog and therefore has a strong, instinctive prey drive. Weimaraners will sometimes tolerate cats, but usually not, they tend to still engage in their hunting abilities no matter how long they've known a particular cat, and in many time will chase and frequently kill almost any small animal that enters their garden or backyard. In rural areas, most Weimaraners will not hesitate to chase deer or sheep. &nbsp; <h2>Health</h2> According to the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals, Weimaraners enjoy low rates of dysplasia. The breed is ranked 102nd of 153 total breeds and has a very high test rate and a very high percentage of excellent rating among those dogs tested. It is generally recommended to acquire Weimaraners only from breeders who have their dogs' hips tested using OFA or PennHIPmethods. As a deep-chested dog, the Weimaraner is prone to bloat or gastric torsion, a very serious condition that can cause painful and rapid death when left untreated. It occurs when the stomach twists itself, thereby pinching off blood vessels and the routes of food traveling in or out. Symptoms include signs of general distress, discomfort, no bowel movement or sounds, and a swollen stomach. Immediate medical attention is imperative when bloat occurs and surgery is the only option if it is caught early enough. One way to help prevent bloat is to spread out the Weimaraner's feedings to at least twice daily and to avoid any vigorous exercise an hour before or after meals. It is also recommended that the dog's feeding dish not be placed on a raised platform to discourage it from gobbling its food too quickly and keep air from entering the stomach. Raised food bowls have been found to more than double the risk of bloat in large dogs.<sup id=""cite_ref-7""> </sup> Skin allergies can affect some dogs. Take your dog to the vet if he starts to lose hair, itch constantly or develop rashes. You should also check for dog for parasites, as they can cause an allergic reaction in addition to the normal irritation from bites.

For their size, however, they need a surprising amount of daily physical and mental stimulation. Cardigans are a very versatile breed and a wonderful family companion. Pembrokes and Cardigans first appeared together in dog shows in 1925 when they were shown under the rules of The Kennel Club in Britain. The Corgi Club was founded in December, 1925 in Carmarthen in South Wales. It is reported that the local members favored the Pembroke breed, so a club for Cardigan enthusiasts was founded a year later (1926). Both groups have worked hard to ensure the appearance and type of breed are standardized through careful selective breeding.

Cardigans come in a variety of colors including any shade of red, sable, or brindle, as well as black, with or without tan, brindle or blue merle, with or without tan or brindle points. Other unofficial colors can occur, such as red merle, but these colors are not considered acceptable per the Cardigan standard. They usually have white on the neck, chest, legs, muzzle, underneath, tip of the tail and as a blaze on the head, known as the ""Irish pattern."" Other markings include ticking on the legs and muzzle, smutty muzzles and monk's hoods, especially on sables (a pattern of darker tipped hairs over a basic red coat color. An average Cardigan is around 10.5 to 13  inches (260 to 315 mm) tall at the withers and weighs from 30 to 38 lb. (13.6 to 17.2 kg) for the male and 25 to 34 lb.

It is said that the Vikings and Flemish weavers brought the dogs with them as they traveled to reside in Wales. As far back as the 10th century, Corgis were herding sheep, geese, ducks, horses and cattle as one of the oldest herding breed of dogs. Pembroke Welsh Corgis are closely related to Schipperkes, Keeshonds, Pomeranians, Samoyeds, Chow Chows, Norwegian Elkhounds andFinnish Spitz. Pembrokes and Cardigans first appeared together in 1925 when they were shown under the rules of The Kennel Club in Britain. The Corgi Club was founded in December, 1925 in Carmarthen, Carmarthenshire. It is reported that the local members favored the Pembroke breed, so a club for Cardigan enthusiasts was founded a year or so later. Both groups have worked hard to ensure the appearance and type of breed are standardized through careful selective breeding. Pembrokes and Cardigans were officially recognized by the Kennel Club in 1928 and were initially categorized together under the single heading of Welsh Corgis, before the two breeds were recognized as separate and distinct in 1934.<sup id=""cite_ref-Eldredge2009_12-5""> </sup> Pembroke Welsh Corgis are becoming more popular in the United States and rank 24th in American Kennel Club registrations, as of 2012. <h3>Appearance</h3> The Corgi is proportional to larger breeds but has shorter legs, yet has a sturdy appearance and an athletic body that helps it herd livestock such as poultry, sheep and cattle. Its body is long, and it has a naturally long, bobbed, or artificially docked tail and erect, big ears. The corgi's head should be foxy in shape and appearance. They differ from the closely related Cardigan Welsh Corgi by being shorter in length and having straighter legs.<sup id=""cite_ref-akc.org_5-1""> </sup> Pembroke Welsh Corgis are 10 to 12 inches (25 to 30 cm) tall from their feet to the top of their shoulders. The length from the shoulders to the set on of the tail is 40 percent longer than their height. Pembrokes in peak athletic condition weigh Male: 25 to 30 pounds (11 to 14 kg) with 27 pounds (12 kg) considered as Show Condition, Female: 23 to 28 pounds (10 to 13 kg) with 25 pounds (11 kg) considered as Show Condition. They reach their full height by 9 months old, but their bodies keep filling out until they reach full maturity at two years. Pembrokes have a big appetite, so they can weigh up to 38 pounds (17 kg) if allowed to overeat. Pembroke Welsh Corgis can benefit from portion control and exercise. <h3>Temperament</h3> Pembroke Welsh Corgis are very affectionate, love to be involved in the family, and tend to follow wherever their owners go. They have a great desire to please their owners, thus making them eager to learn and train. The dogs are easy to train and are ranked as the eleventh smartest dogin <i>Stanley Coren's The Intelligence of Dogs</i>. Besides herding, they also function as watchdogs due to their alertness and tendency to bark only as needed. Most Pembrokes will seek the attention of everyone they meet and behave well around children and other pets. It is important to socialise this breed with other animals, adults and children when they are very young to avoid any anti-social behavior or aggression later in life. Due to their herding instinct, they love to chase anything that moves, so it is best to keep them inside fenced areas. The herding instinct will also cause some younger Pembrokes to nip at their owner's ankles.<sup id=""cite_ref-akc.org_5-3""> </sup> <h2>Health</h2> Pembrokes have an average life expectancy of 12?15 years. Health problems may include degenerative myelopathy, hip dysplasia, andVon Willebrand's disease if their parents suffered from the same problems.<sup id=""cite_ref-11""> </sup> Pembrokes descend from the line that is the northern spitz-type dog (examples include that of the Siberian Husky).<sup id=""cite_ref-Eldredge2009_12-0""><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pembroke_Welsh_Corgi#cite_note-Eldredge2009-12""> </a></sup> [button link=""http://alphamatch.com/listing-type/pets/?pet-type=1081&amp;breed-2=1035"" color=""black"" type=""big-button"" type=""Search for Pembroke Welsh Corgi""]Search for Pembroke Welsh Corgi[/button]",NULL,NULL,NULL,"Y","0"

Like other types of working dog, Welsh Sheepdogs are normally bred for their herding abilities rather than appearance, and so they are generally somewhat variable in build, colour and size. Welsh Sheepdogs are of collie type, usually black-and-white, red-and-white or tricolour, and merle markings may occur over any of these combinations. The coat may be short or fairly long, and the ears are pricked, but usually folded at the tip. They are longer in leg, broader in chest and wider in muzzle than the Border Collie. They are extremely active and intelligent, and therefore need much exercise and mental stimulation, if they are to be kept as pets. Welsh Sheepdogs are more commonly known as Welsh Collies, however these are the same breed. At one time there existed many sheep-herding dogs peculiar to Wales; during the 18th century Welsh drovers taking sheep for sale took with them five or six Welsh Sheepdogs as ""herders on the narrow roads, guards against highwaymen, and providers of game on the route"". These were an early type of Welsh Sheepdog, higher on the leg and more racily built than the modern day breed."".<sup id=""cite_ref-Hubbard_1-1""> </sup> However, by the 1940s the group had decreased to two or three breeds only. The ancient pure breeds of Black-and-Tan-Sheepdog and Welsh Hillman were almost extinct , and were scarcely ever seen working. The type best known in Wales at that time was mostly descended from the old Black-and-Tan with an infusion of working Border Collie blood.<sup id=""cite_ref-Hubbard_1-3""> </sup> In the 1940s the Welsh Sheepdog was common throughout the north and central Welsh counties. In herding activities it did not normally work low to the ground in ""the showy manner sometimes seen in the work of the working [Border] Collies"". It was variable in type; approximately 18 in (46 cm) in height, but the weight ranged from the lighter built, leggier dog of North Wales at 35 lb (16 kg) to the more solid 40 to 45 lb (18 to 20 kg) dogs of Glamorganshire and Monmouthshire. There were no dog show classes for the Welsh Sheepdog as it was purely a working breed.<sup id=""cite_ref-Hubbard_1-5""> </sup> &nbsp; [button link=""http://alphamatch.com/listing-type/pets/?pet-type=1081&amp;breed-2=1035"" color=""black"" type=""big-button"" type=""Search for Welsh Sheepdog""]Search for Welsh Sheepdog[/button]",NULL,NULL,NULL,"Y","0"

Thought to be comparable to the old Land Spaniel, they are similar to the English Springer Spaniel and historically have been referred to as both the <b>Welsh Spaniel</b> and the <b>Welsh Cocker Spaniel</b>. They were relatively unknown until a succession of victories in dog trials by the breed increased its popularity. Following recognition by The Kennel Club in 1902, the breed gained the modern name of Welsh Springer Spaniel. The breed's coat only comes in a single colour combination of white with red markings, usually in a piebald pattern. Loyal and affectionate, they can become very attached to family members and are wary of strangers. Health conditions are limited to those common among many breeds of dog, although they are affected more than average by hip dysplasia and some eye conditions. They are a working dog, bred for hunting, and while not as rare as some varieties of spaniel, they are rarer than the more widely known English Springer Spaniel with which they are sometimes confused. The actual date of origin of the Welsh Springer Spaniel cannot be traced, however dogs resembling the breed with its distinctive red and white coat are frequently depicted in old pictures and prints. This type of dog was known as the Land Spaniel, and is considered to be similar to the modern Welsh Springer. John Caius, writing in 1570 said ""Spaniels whose skynnes are white and if marked with any spottes they are commonly red"". It is thought that these Spaniels may have made their way into the Welsh valleys where local sportsman and hunters managed to conserve them in a pure state.<sup id=""cite_ref-gundogtraining_3-1""> </sup> At one time called the Welsh Starter, it was used to spring game, originally for hunters using falcons. The traditional red and white colour of the Welsh Springer was once also found in English dogs, but by the early 20th century any such dogs were considered to have ""died out long ago"".<sup id=""cite_ref-5""> </sup> The Welsh Springer Spaniel was also at one time called the Welsh Spaniel, and also at one point was included in the Kennel Club (UK) studbook as Cocker Spaniels, and was known as the Welsh Cocker. During the 19th century were several different varieties of Cocker Spaniel, including the English, the Welsh and the Devonshire as the term was used to describe the size of the dog rather than the breed. Unusually, in John George Wood's 1865 book <i>The Illustrated Natural History</i>, an image is described showing a Welsh Cocker Spaniel as a solid coloured dark spaniel. The same inscription is used in the 1867 work <i>The Dog in Health and Disease</i> by Stonehenge and he further describes the Welsh Cocker and the Devonshire Cocker as ""both being of a deep-liver colour"". The Welsh Springer was relatively unknown during the 19th Century, but this changed in 1900 when Mr. A. T. Williams of Ynis-y-Gerwn won the team stake at the Sporting Spaniel Club Trials. The trials were held on Mr. Williams' own estate, and it was thought that when his team defeated eight well known teams it was because of the home advantage. This was disproved when dogs from the same kennel went on to win in successive years around the UK. His conformation show champion dog Corrin was the first Welsh Welsh Springers were recognised by The Kennel Club, after the breed had gained popularity, in 1902 under the new name of Welsh Springer Spaniel. Until then the breed was shown alongside the English Springer Spaniel. The Welsh Springer Spaniel was transported to America in the late 19th century and gained recognition by the American Kennel Club in 1906.<sup id=""cite_ref-akchist_10-0""> </sup> World War I caused problems for the breed in the United Kingdom, and when the war was over there were no dogs whose parents had registered pedigrees. The breed restarted with the remaining unregistered dogs, and it is these dogs that formed the modern day breed. The breeders in the 1920s and 1930s developed these dogs into the type of Welsh Springer Spaniel which remains today. The Welsh Springer Spaniel Club (UK) was formed in 1923, registrations slowly increased between the wars but all records held by the breed club were destroyed in an air raid during World War II. Following the two World Wars, it was thought that no Welsh Springers remained in the United States. The breed was reintroduced, and the descendants of those dogs make up the breed today in the United States and Canada. The breed was officially imported into Australia in 1973.<sup id=""cite_ref-burke_4-2""> </sup> In 2000, The Kennel Club registered 424 Welsh Springer Spaniels, compared with 12,599 English Springer Spaniels and 13,445 English Cocker Spaniels.

Numbers remain closer to the American Cocker Spaniel which registered 610 in 2000, and 599 in 2004.

Their body can give the impression of length due to its obliquely angled forequarters and developed hindquarters. The build of the Welsh Springer Spaniel should be slightly off square, meaning that the length of the dog should be slightly greater than the height at the withers. However, some dogs may be square, and this is not penalised in the show ring as long as the height is never greater than the length. Traditionally a docked breed, dependant on legislation in the country of origin, and where allowed the dew claws can be removed.<sup id=""cite_ref-16""> </sup> In conformation showing, eyes should be brown in colour; yellow eyes do sometimes occur but are penalised in the show ring. Ears are small, pendulous (suspended and hanging), vine-shaped and with a light setter-like feathering. Nostrils are well developed and are black or any shade of brown; a pink nose is penalised in the AKC standard for the show ring, in Britain the colour is not specified in The Kennel Club'sbreed standard. In showing, a scissors bite is preferred with an undershot jaw severely penalised. Unlike the English Springer Spaniel and English Cocker Spaniel, there is no divergence into show and field types of the breed.<sup id=""cite_ref-spanieldog_18-0""> </sup> Male dogs are 18 to 19 inches (46 to 48 cm) high at the withers, with females a little smaller at 17 to 18 inches (43 to 46 cm). On average, members of the breed weigh between 35 to 45 lb (16 to 20 kg). The back of the legs, chest, and underside of the body are feathered, and the ears and tail are lightly feathered. The only colour is a rich red-and-white. Any pattern is acceptable and any white area may be flecked with red ticking.<sup id=""cite_ref-akc_15-4""> </sup> <h3>Temperament</h3> The Welsh Springer Spaniel is an active, loyal, and affectionate breed. They may meet unfamiliar strangers with barking when in the dog's territory, or act aloof, cautious or wary. The breed is well known for being friendly and demonstrative to all members of the family, especially children, and accepting other pets of the household with a friendly, playful attitude.<sup id=""cite_ref-sarah_12-1""> </sup> The breed is quick to learn but can be headstrong, though with correct training can become very obedient. The Welsh Springer was bred for work and endurance, and as with many breeds of hunting dogs requires a regular exercise routine to keep them healthy and content. Without adequate exercise, a Welsh Springer Spaniel may appear hyperactive. Some Welsh Springers can become clingy towards their owners and suffer separation anxiety when alone.<sup id=""cite_ref-sportingspaniel_26-1""> </sup> <h2>Health</h2> The Welsh Springer is generally a healthy breed, but some can suffer conditions common to many breeds such as hip dysplasia, Canine glaucoma and like other dogs with pendulous ears, they are prone to ear infections such as otitis externa. In a survey of over a hundred breeds of dog conducted in 1997, the Welsh Springer Spaniel was ranked 14th for worst hip score, with the average score of the breed being 18.45. The average lifespan is 12 to 15 years.

It was originally bred for hunting fox, rodents and badger, but during the last century it has mainly been bred for showing. Despite this, it has retained its terrier strength of character. The Welsh Terrier originates from Wales and has been claimed to be the oldest existing dog breed in the UK according to research. The Welsh Terrier was a latecomer to the British show-ring (being primarily a working dog) and was not officially registered as a breed until the 19th century. It is currently on the UK Kennel Clubs list of breeds that are in danger of dying out, having as few as 300 or so pups registered annually, as compared to the nation's most popular breeds that are registered in the tens of thousands each year. <h3>Appearance</h3> The Welsh Terrier is colored tan on the head, legs and underbelly while having a black or sometimes grizzle saddle.This is not always the case with female terriers as they are sometimes a simple darker tan all over. The breed is a sturdy and compact dog of about medium size that can grow up to 15.5 in (39 cm) with a weight of 20?22 pounds (9.1?10.0 kg). The tail was usually docked until this was prohibited in the United Kingdom in 2006, being preferred in order to complete the image of a square dog, as tall as it is long. The body shape is rectangular, with elongated, ""brick-like"" face. This shape is formed by the whiskers and beard. With pedigrees the face can take a more oval shape and be finer boned and more distinct. The hair contains two layers, an undercoat that insulates and an abrasive fur on top that protects against dirt, rain, and wind. Welsh Terriers are born mostly all black and during the first year they change the color to standard black and tan grizzle. A Welsh Terrier's coat can smell, since they are one of the few breeds to perspire through sweat glands. This breed does not shed. However, the coat requires regular maintenance including brushing and hand stripping. An undocked Welsh Terrier tail is only an inch or so longer than a docked tail and does not make a great deal of difference to the overall appearance. The coat does not moult out but old hairs will eventually be stripped out through play and movement if the coat is not regularly raked. Ungroomed coats can also fade and thin out as the old hair loses colour and texture. to keep a moult free house and a good coat on your Welsh Terrier it is necessary to rake out the coat on a regular basis. Welsh terriers need some grooming. Their fur grows a little long. <h3>Temperament</h3> <div>The Welsh Terrier has a typical terrier temperament. In the right hands, it is a happy, lively, and seldom shy or timid dog, but sometimes can have an attitude. The Welsh Terrier is generally friendly with people and dogs but when a challenge is perceived, he will not back down. Dogs of this breed can be devoted friends and can function either as city dogs or as country dogs.</div> Welsh Terriers were developed to hunt independently and this required that they be very assertive and stoic dogs. As a consequence, developing obedience in a Welsh Terrier is a long term proposition and one has to constantly work on and reinforce the training. They rank 53rd in Stanley Coren's The Intelligence of Dogs, being of average working/obedience intelligence. This, however, does not mean that Welsh Terriers fail to learn or understand commands, just that they tend to make their own decisions; thus the need for constant reinforcement. When acting on their own, they are quite creative and quick in decision making. They also have the potential for excessive barking. Like other terrier breeds, the Welsh Terrier enjoys digging. <h2>Health</h2> The body of the Welsh Terrier is normal and healthy so that the physique is durable and lasting. Some studies have suggested a genetic predisposition to Primary Lens Luxation which results in secondary glaucoma. A healthy Welsh Terrier lives around 12 to 13 years on average and stays active and alert up to a high age if it is well taken care of and healthy. &nbsp; [button link=""http://alphamatch.com/listing-type/pets/?pet-type=1081&amp;breed-2=1035"" color=""black"" type=""big-button"" type=""Search for Welsh Terrier""]Search for Welsh Terrier[/button]",NULL,NULL,NULL,"Y","0"

The modern breed is descended from a number of breeding programs of white terriers in Scotland prior to the 20th century. Edward Donald Malcolm, 16th Laird of Poltalloch, is credited with the creation of the modern breed from his Poltalloch Terrier, but did not want to be known as such. Other related breeds included George Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll's Roseneath Terrier and Dr. Americ Edwin Flaxman's Pittenweem Terriers. The breeds of small white Scottish terriers were given its modern name for the first time in 1908, with recognition by major kennel clubs occurring around the same time. The breed remains very popular in the UK and is in the top third of all breeds in the US since the 1960s. It has been featured in television and film including in <i>Hamish Macbeth</i> and in advertising by companies such as Cesar dog food and Scottish whisky Black &amp; White. It is a medium-sized terrier, although with longer legs than other Scottish breeds of terrier. It has a white double coat of fur which fills out the dog's face giving it a rounded appearance. The breed can be good with children, but will not always tolerate rough handling. The Westie is an active breed, but are social with a high prey drive, as they were once used to hunt rodents. Several breed-specific and non-specific health issues appear in the breed including a condition in young dogs nicknamed ""westie jaw"" which causes an overgrowth of bone in the jaw of the dog. It is also prone to skin disorders, with a breed-specific condition called Hyperplastic Dermatosis occurring. They are very energetic and need plenty of exercise. Cousin to the ""Scotty"", the Westie was bred to hunt small rodents at places such as farms. Scottish white terriers were recorded as early as during the reign of James VI of Scotland, who reigned between 1567 and 1625. The king ordered that a dozen terriers be procured from Argyll to be presented to the Kingdom of France as a gift. Sandy and brindle coloured dogs were seen as hardier than those of other colours, and white dogs were seen as being weak. At various times during the breed's existence, it has been considered a white offshoot of both the Scottish Terrier and the Cairn Terrier breeds.<sup id=""cite_ref-rice5_3-0""> </sup> There were also reports of a ship from the Spanish Armada being wrecked on the island of Skye in 1588. This ship carried white Spanish dogs, whose descendants were kept distinct from other breeds by Clan Donald, including the families of the Chiefs. Other families on Skye preserved both white and sandy coloured dogs. One such family was the Clan MacLeod, and it was reported by their descendants that at least two Chiefs kept white terriers, including ""The Wicked Man"" Norman MacLeod, and his grandson Norman who became Chief after his death.<sup id=""cite_ref-smith84_2-1""> </sup> George Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll, chief of Clan Campbell, bred a breed of white Scottish terriers known as the ""Roseneath Terrier"". Another breed of white Scottish terriers also appeared at this point, with Dr. Americ Edwin Flaxman from Fife developing his line of ""Pittenweem Terriers"" out of a female Scottish Terrier which produced white offspring. The dog seemed to produce these white puppies regardless of the sire to which it was bred, and after drowning over twenty of these offspring, he came upon the theory that it was an ancient trait of the Scottish Terrier that was trying to re-appear. He rededicated his breeding program to produce white Scottish Terriers with the aim of restoring it to the same stature as the dark coloured breed. Flaxman is credited with classes being added to dog shows for white Scottish Terriers towards the end of the 19th century.<sup id=""cite_ref-doggypeople_6-0""> </sup> The person most closely associated with developing the modern breed of West Highland White Terrier is Edward Donald Malcolm, 16th Laird of Poltalloch. Malcolm owned terriers used to work game, the story told is that a reddish-brown terrier was mistaken for a fox and shot. Following this Malcolm decided to develop a white terrier breed, which became known as the ""Poltalloch Terrier"". The first generation of Poltallochs had sandy coloured coats, and had already developed prick ears which is a trait seen later in the modern breed. It is unknown if the Poltalloch Terriers and Pittenweem Terriers were interbred. In 1903 Malcolm declared that he didn't want to be known as the creator of the breed and insisted that his breed of white terriers was renamed. The term ""West Highland White Terrier"" first appears in <i>Otters and Otter Hunting</i> by L.C.R. Cameron, published in 1908.<sup id=""cite_ref-malcolmincanada_5-4""></sup><sup id=""cite_ref-7""> </sup> The first breed club was set up in 1904; Niall Campbell, 10th Duke of Argyll, was the society's first president. A second club was subsequently set up, with the Countess of Aberdeen as Chairman. Edward Malcolm succeeded the Countess as the club's second chairman. Kennel Clubrecognition followed in 1907, and the breed appeared at Crufts for the first time in the same year. The Westie was imported into the United States in 1907-1908, when Robert Goelet imported Ch. Kiltie and Ch. Rumpus Glenmohr. Initially it was also known at the time as the Roseneath Terrier, and the Roseneath Terrier Club was recognised by the American Kennel Club in 1908. The club was renamed during the following year to the West Highland White Terrier Club of America. The breed spent the period that immediately followed as being ""in vogue"", becoming popular almost immediately upon its arrival in the US. Canadian Kennel Club recognition followed in 1909. Until 1924 in the UK, Westie pedigrees were allowed to have Cairn and Scottish Terriers in them. By the time of Malcolm's death in 1930, a stable type had appeared with prick ears, a white coat and a short back.<sup id=""cite_ref-malcolmincanada_5-7""> </sup> [button link=""http://alphamatch.com/listing-type/pets/?pet-type=1081&amp;breed-2=1035"" color=""black"" type=""big-button"" type=""Search for West Highland White Terrier""]Search for West Highland White Terrier[/button] <h2>Temperament</h2> The temperament of the West Highland White Terrier can vary greatly, with some being friendly towards children whilst others prefer solitude. It will not tolerate rough handling such as a child pulling on its ears, and can be both food and toy possessive. Members of the breed are normally independent, assured and self-confident and can make good watchdogs. It is a loyal breed that bonds with its owners, but is often always on the move requiring good exercise (15-30 min). Westies are highly social and are the most friendly and jolly of all the Scottish breeds of terrier.<sup id=""cite_ref-rice6_18-0""> </sup> It is a hardy breed, and can be stubborn leading to issues with training. A Westie may need to have its training refreshed on occasion during its lifetime. Having a typical terrier prey drive, it tends to be highly interested in toys especially chasing balls. It does retain the instincts of an earth-dog, including inquisitive and investigative traits, as well as natural instincts to both bark and dig holes.<sup id=""cite_ref-sanfraniswestie_17-1""></sup><sup id=""cite_ref-19""> </sup> <h2>Health</h2> The American breed club puts the lifespan of the Westie at 12 to 16 years. A club survey puts the average lifespan at 11.4 years. Veterinary clinic data from the UK shows an average of 10.5 to 15 years. The average litter size is between three and five puppies. However some litters may contain more than this, one of which was a Westie called Isobel who gave birth to a litter of eleven puppies on 10 April 2012. The breed is predisposed to conditions found in many breeds, such as abdominal hernias.<sup id=""cite_ref-ackerman115_24-0"">[24]</sup> Westie puppies may be affected by Craniomandibular osteopathy, a disease also known ""lion jaw"", and is sometimes also referred to as ""westie jaw"". The disease is an autosomal recessive condition and so a puppy can only be affected by it if both its parents are carriers of the faultygene. The condition appears across many breeds, including several different types of terrier, as well as other unrelated breeds such as the Great Dane. It typically appears in dogs under a year old, and can cause problems for the dog to chew or swallow food. Radiographic testing can be conducted to diagnose the condition, in which the bones around the jaw thicken; additionally the blood may show increased calcium levels and enzyme levels. The condition often stops progressing by the time the dog is a year old, and in some cases can recede. It is normally treated with anti-inflammatory medications, and the feeding of soft foods. In some cases, tube feeding may be necessary. However, if the animal still cannot eat and is in uncontrolled pain, then euthanasia may be the only medical option remaining.<sup id=""cite_ref-ackerman1167_25-0""> </sup> The breed is prone to skin disorders. About a quarter of Westies surveyed are affected by atopic dermatitis, a heritable chronic allergic skin condition. A higher proportion of males are affected compared to females. There is an uncommon but severe breed-specific skin condition that may affect West Highland White Terriers affecting both juveniles and adults dogs. This condition is called Hyperplastic Dermatosis. Affected dogs can suffer from red hyperpigmentation, lichenification and hair loss. In the initial stages, this condition can be misdiagnosed as allergies or less serious forms of dermatitis.<sup id=""cite_ref-27""> </sup> An inherited genetic problem that exists in the breed is globoid cell leukodystrophy. It is not breed specific, and can appear in Cairn Terriers and other breeds including Beagles and Pomeranians. It is a neurological disease where the dog lacks an enzyme called galactosylceramidase. The symptoms are noticeable as the puppy develops, and can be identified by the age of 30 weeks. Affected dogs will have tremors, muscle weakness, and trouble walking. Symptoms will slowly increase until limb paralysis begins to occur. Due to it being a hereditary condition, it is recommended for owners to avoid breeding affected animals in order to eliminate it from the breed. Another genetic condition that affects the breed is ""White dog shaker syndrome"". As this condition is most commonly found in Westies and in Maltese, the condition was originally thought to be connected to the genes for white coats, however the same condition has since been found in other non-white breeds including the Yorkshire Terrier and the Dachshund. The condition typically develops over one to three days resulting in tremors of the head and limbs, ataxia and hypermetria. Affected males and females can be affected for different lengths of time, with symptoms in females lasting for between four to six weeks, while males can be affected the rest of its life.

They are a sighthound breed that originated in England, where they descended from greyhounds. Whippets today still strongly resemble a smaller greyhound. Shown in the Hound group, Whippets have relatively few health problems other than arrhythmia. Whippets also participate in dog sports such as lure coursing, agility, and flyball. Whippets were originally greyhounds that were deemed unsuitable for hunting because of their size. They were returned to their peasantbreeders after being maimed so that they could not be used to hunt and break the Forest law. These maimed dogs were bred together and used to catch rats, and hunt rabbits. When the Forest law was repealed, these ""miniature greyhounds"" became popular in the sport of dog racing. This has led to Whippets being described as ""the poor man's racehorse."" They are still frequently used as racing dogs today, as they have the highest running speed of breeds their weight: 35 miles per hour (56 km/h). <div></div> Whippets were bred to hunt by sight, coursing game in open areas at high speeds. One can find numerous representations of small greyhound-like hounds in art dating back to Ancient Egyptiantimes. Pharaohs bred a small sighthound dog related to the greyhound to keep in their palaces, and this dog may be the ancestor of today's Whippets. In medieval England, a small greyhound breed became popular for use as a ratting dog. The first written English use of the word <i>whippet</i>with regard to a type of dog was in 1610. However, the first dog to be called a Whippet was actually a greyhound-spaniel cross and has little to do with the modern Whippet.<sup id=""cite_ref-Barron7_5-2""> </sup> The original Whippets were thought to be English Greyhounds that were too small for stag huntingin the forests of England. These dogs were frequently returned to their breeders, who were usuallypeasants and as such could not own hunting dogs under the Forest law. Because of this, dogs returned to them were maimed, usually by cutting a tendon in a leg or removing the toes on one paw. The breeders kept these dogs and continued to breed them, producing a smaller version of a greyhound that was suited for rat catching and hunting hares and rabbits. When the Forest Law was repealed, the ""small greyhounds"" became immensely popular. Whippets were then commonly known as ""snap dogs"" for their tendency to ""snap up"" nearby prey.<sup id=""cite_ref-Barron7_5-4""> </sup> <h3>Appearance</h3> Whippets are a medium-sized dog weighing from 15 to 30 pounds (6.8 to 13.6 kg).

Korthals' dream was to create the ideal versatile gun dog; one with extreme resiliency, vigor, and devotion to its master. The dog would also have to work close to its master, and be open to training. Korthals' breeding line began in 1874 with ""Mouche"", who would be used as its foundation bitch, as well as five other dogs described as ""Griffons"": Janus, Satan, Banco, Hector, and Junon. He interbred the dogs carefully until offspring were produced that resembled his dream pointing dog. Much speculation is given as to which other breeds contributed to Korthals' line. Some sources refer to other pointers from Germany and France, others point to continental Spaniels, while still others believe English and French waterdogs played a part in creating the Wirehaired Pointing Griffon. In any event, the resulting offspring (Moustache I, Lina, and Querida) are referred to as the ""Korthals Patriarchs"" because they are the Griffon's direct ancestors. However, these dogs still looked very different from today's modern Griffon. The American Kennel Club's first registered Wirehaired Pointing Griffon was ""Zolette"", who was entered into the stud book in 1887. However, the Griffon was still relatively unknown, and she was registered as a ""Russian Setter(Griffon)"" for her presumed Russian heritage. It was not until 1916, twenty-nine years later, that the breed was officially recognized in the United States. In that same year, sixteen Griffons appeared in the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show, one of the most prestigious shows in the country. Since then, the breed has grown in popularity as not only a show dog but also a versatile gun dog, Korthals' original intention for the breed. For the most part, the breed still resembles his original intentions: a medium size, harsh coat, good degree of trainability, and resilient on the field and in the ring.<sup id=""cite_ref-AKC_4-0""> </sup> <h2>Appearance</h2> The Wirehaired Pointing Griffon is a medium-sized dog with a harsh, wiry coat. According to its AKC standard, the coat is preferably steel gray with brown markings. Other acceptable colors: chestnut brown, white and brown, roan, and white and orange. All brown, all white or white and orange are less desirable. A black coat disqualifies. Tan point coloration is substandard and indicates existence of the tan gene. The Griffon should have flat ears that lie close to the head, and eyes that are either yellow or brown. Its nose must be brown. <h2>Health and temperament</h2> Wirehaired Pointing Griffons are known as intelligent, extremely eager to please, friendly dogs. A standing joke among Griffon owners is that a nice thing about a Griff is that you get to have a puppy for a long time - and a bad thing about a Griff is that you get to have a puppy for a long time. Certainly, many individual Griffons retain their puppy playfulness well into adulthood. They are also known for their slightly less excitable temperament when not in the field, which makes them a very comfortable dog to have living in your home. Most Griffons do not take well to living their lives in kennels. They are extremely people oriented and prefer to be somewhere in the vicinity of their owners. Due to breed organizations, kennels, and owners having a strong commitment to the health of the breed, breed programs are overwhelmingly very selective in breeding dogs that are OFA/Penn Hip, CERF, and temperament clear. As a result, instances of congenital diseases and conditions are relatively low, and most Griffons live long and healthy lives.

Despite its name, the breed was not developed in Australia, but rather in the United States where they were seen in the West as early as the 1800s. The breed rose gradually in popularity with the boom of western riding after World War I. They became known to the general public through rodeos, horse shows, and Disney movies made for television. For many years, Aussies have been valued by stockmen for their versatility and trainability. They have a similar look to the popular English Shepherd and Border Collie breeds. While they continue to work as stockdogs and compete in herding trials, the breed has earned recognition in other roles due to their trainability and eagerness to please, and are highly regarded for their skills in obedience. Like all working breeds, the Aussie has considerable energy and drive, and usually needs a job to do. It often excels at dog sports such as dog agility, flyball, and frisbee. They are also highly successful search and rescue dogs, disaster dogs, detection dogs, guide, service, and therapy dogs. <div id=""bodyContent""> <div dir=""ltr"" id=""mw-content-text"" lang=""en""> <h2>Temperament</h2> The breed is typically highly energetic, requiring a great deal of exercise and attention, although some can be calm and easy-going. Aussies are also one of the few breeds known for ""smiling"" by baring their teeth. An Australian shepherd enjoys working, whether it is learning and practicing tricks, competing in dog agility, or engaging in any other physically and mentally involving activity.<sup id=""cite_ref-ReferenceB_9-0""> </sup> Dogs may show reserved and cautious guarding behaviors. They are kind, loving, and devoted to those they know. They are very loyal to their owners, and are rewarding dogs if treated well. Because the breed was developed to serve on the ranch, a job which includes being protective of its property, it is inclined to bark warnings about neighborhood activity. It is not inclined toward obsessive barking. The Aussie is intelligent, learns quickly, and loves to play. This means that a bored, neglected, unexercised Aussie may invent its own games, activities, and jobs, which to a busy owner might appear to be hyperactivity: for example, an Aussie may go from being at rest to running at top speed for several ""laps"" around the house before returning to rest. Without something to amuse them, Aussies can become destructive. Aussies also do best with plenty of human companionship: they are often called ""Velcro Dogs"" for their strong desire to always be near their owners and for their tendency to form intense, devoted bonds with select people.<sup id=""cite_ref-ReferenceB_9-2""> </sup> The Australian shepherd has a reputation as a highly intelligent and versatile stock dog with a range of working styles. A good working Aussie is quick, thoughtful, and easy with its stock. The ability for the breed to adapt to the situation and think for itself makes it an excellent all-around worker. For this reason the Aussie is often chosen to work unusual livestock such as ducks, geese, and commercially raised rabbits. Australian shepherds can become extremely destructive if their energy is not directed in a positive way. These dogs require a minimum of 2?3 hours a day of play, exercise, and attention. They thrive in rural, ranch like conditions, and need space to run and play in an urban setting. The Australian shepherd is a high-spirited dog, that requires much attention and work. Teaching them tricks keeps them focused and happy, which also keeps their minds working. The breed also has great stamina and can live in a variety of terrain. That's why they are a popular pick as trail dogs and working dogs.<sup id=""cite_ref-ReferenceC_10-1""> </sup> <h3>Color</h3> Aussie colors are black, red (sometimes called <i>liver</i>), blue merle (marbled black, white and gray), and red merle (marbled red, white and buff), each of these colors may also have copper (tan) points or white markings in various combination on the face, chest, and legs. A black or red dog with copper and white trim is called <i>tricolor</i> or <i>tri</i>, a black or red dog with white trim but no copper is called <i>bicolor</i> or <i>bi</i>. White, rather than pigment, on or around the ears is an indicator of increased risk for white-related deafness. Excessive white on the face and ears can place an individual dog at greater risk for sunburn and subsequent skin cancer. The wide variation of color combinations comes from the interaction between the a color allele, which is either black (B) dominant or red (b) recessive, and the dominant merle allele (M). Together, these provide four coat-color aspects that can appear in any combination:<sup id=""cite_ref-Coile_6-0""> </sup> <ul> <li>Black, with tan points, white markings, or both on the face, collar, legs, chest, underbelly. Solid black dogs are equally desirable as ones with tan or white.</li> <li>Red (Liver) with or without tan points or white markings on the face, collar, legs, chest, underbelly. Either white or tan points are required. Solid Red dogs are equally desirable as ones with tan or white.</li> <li>Blue Merle (a mottled patchwork of gray and black) with or without tan points or white markings on the face, collar, legs, chest, underbelly.
